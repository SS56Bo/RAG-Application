       "  'text': 'xv preface No one knows whether reading a technical book is going to be worth the effort. These books can be expensive, dull, and poorly written. Even worse, there’s a good chance that you won’t learn anything. Luckily, this book is written by someone who under- stands that.  This book’s first aim is to teach you Rust. Rust in Action presents large, working projects to promote your learning. Over the course of the book, you’ll write a data- base, a CPU emulator, an operating system kernel, and several other interesting proj- ects. You’ll even dabble with generative art. Each project is designed to enable you to explore the Rust programming language at your own pace. For those readers who know little Rust, there are many opportunities to expand the projects in whatever direction you choose.  There is more to learning a programming language than studying its syntax and semantics, however. You are also joining a community. Unfortunately, established communities can create invisible barriers for new entrants because of their shared knowledge, jargon, and practices.  One such barrier for many new Rust programmers is the concept of systems pro- gramming. Lots of programmers come to Rust without a background in that area. To compensate for this, Rust in Action has a second aim—to teach you systems pro- gramming. And, among other topics, you’ll learn about how memory, digital time- keeping, and device drivers work in the book’s 12 chapters. I hope this enables you to feel more comfortable when becoming a member of the Rust community. And we need you!'},\n",

       "  'text': 'PREFACE xvi  Our societies depend on software, yet critical security holes are accepted as normal and, perhaps, inevitable. Rust demonstrates that these are neither. Moreover, our computers are filled with bloated, energy-intensive applications. Rust provides a viable alternative for developing software that is less demanding on these finite resources.  Rust in Action is about empowerment. This book’s ultimate objective is to convince you of that. Rust is not reserved for a select group of experts. It is a tool that’s available for everyone. Well done for making it this far through your learning journey; it’s my pleasure to take you a few more steps.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'xix about this book Rust in Action is primarily intended for people who may have explored Rust’s free material online, but who then have asked themselves, “What’s next?” This book con- tains dozens of examples that are interesting and can be extended as creativity and time allow. Those examples allow the book’s 12 chapters to cover a productive subset of Rust and many of the ecosystem’s most important third-party libraries.  The code examples emphasize accessiblity to beginners over elegant, idiomatic Rust. If you are already a knowledgeable Rust programmer, you may find yourself dis- agreeing with some style decisions in the examples. I hope that you will tolerate this for the sake of learners.  Rust in Action is not intended as a comprehensive reference text book. There are parts of the languages and standard library that have been omitted. Typically, these are highly specialized and deserve specific treatment. Instead, this book aims to pro- vide readers with enough basic knowledge and confidence to learn specialized topics when necessary. Rust in Action is also unique from the point of view of systems pro- gramming books as almost every example works on Microsoft Windows. Who should read this book Anyone who is interested in Rust, who learns by applying practical examples, or who is intimidated by the fact that Rust is a systems programming language will enjoy Rust in Action. Readers with prior programming experience will benefit most as some com- puter programming concepts are assumed.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'ABOUT THIS BOOK xx How this book is organized: A roadmap Rust in Action has two parts. The first introduces Rust’s syntax and some of its distinc- tive characteristics. The second part applies the knowledge gained in part one to sev- eral projects. In each chapter, one or two new Rust concepts are introduced. That said, part 1 provides a quick-fire introduction to Rust: ■ Chapter 1, “Introducing Rust,” explains why Rust exists and how to get started programming with it.  ■ Chapter 2, “Language foundations,” provides a solid base of Rust syntax. Exam- ples include a Mandelbrot set renderer and a grep clone. ■ Chapter 3, “Compound data types,” explains how to compose Rust data types and its error-handling facilities. ■ Chapter 4, “Lifetimes, ownership, and borrowing,” discusses the mechanisms for ensuring that accessing data is always valid. Part 2 applies Rust to introductory systems programming areas: ■ Chapter 5, “Data in Depth,” covers how information is represented in digital computers with a special emphasis on how numbers are approximated. Exam- ples include a bespoke number format and a CPU emulator. ■ Chapter 6, “Memory,” explains the terms references, pointers, virtual mem- ory, stack, and heap. Examples include a memory scanner and a generative art project. ■ Chapter 7, “Files and storage,” explains the process for storing data struc- tures into storage devices. Examples include a hex dump clone and a work- ing database. ■ Chapter 8, “Networking,” provides an explanation of how computers communi- cate by reimplementing HTTP multiple times, stripping away a layer of abstrac- tion each time. ■ Chapter 9, “Time and timekeeping,” explores the process for keeping track of time within a digital computer. Examples include a working NTP client. ■ Chapter 10, “Processes, threads, and containers,” explains processes, threads, and related abstractions. Examples include a turtle graphics application and a parallel parser. ■ Chapter 11, “Kernel,” describes the role of the operating system and how com- puters boot up. Examples include compiling your own bootloader and an oper- ating system kernel. ■ Chapter 12, “Signals, interrupts, and exceptions,” explains how the external world communicates with the CPU and operating systems.  The book is intended to be read linearly. Latter chapters assume knowledge taught in earlier ones. However, projects from each chapter are standalone. Therefore, you are welcome to jump backward and forward if there are topics that you would like to cover.'},\n",

No special software is required outside of a working Rust installation. Installation instructions are provided in chapter 2.  This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered listings and inline with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a fixed-width font, like this, to separate it from ordinary text. Sometimes code is also in bold to highlight code that has changed from the previous steps in the chapter, such as when a new feature is added to an existing line of code.  In many cases, the original source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the book. In rare cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation markers (➥). Additionally, comments in the source code have often been removed from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code annotations accompany many of the listings, highlighting important concepts. liveBook discussion forum Purchase of Rust in Action includes free access to a private web forum run by Manning Publications where you can make comments about the book, ask technical questions, and receive help from the author and from other users: ■ To access the forum, go to https://livebook.manning.com/book/rust-in-action/ welcome/v-16/.  ■ You can also learn more about Manning’s forums and the rules of conduct at this location: https://livebook.manning.com/#!/discussion.

The title of the collection is LesFrançais peints par eux-mêmes, which translates as The French People Painted by Themselves. Each illustration is finely drawn and colored by hand, and the rich variety of drawing in the collection reminds us vividly of how culturally apart the world’s regions, towns, villages, and neighborhoods were just 200 years ago. Isolated from each other, people spoke different dialects and languages. In the streets or in the countryside, it was easy to identify where they lived and what their trade or station in life was just by their dress.  Dress codes have changed since then and the diversity by region, so rich at the time, has faded away. It is now hard to tell apart the inhabitants of different conti- nents, let alone different towns or regions. Perhaps we have traded cultural diversity for a more varied personal life—certainly for a more varied and fast-paced technolog- ical life.  At a time when it is hard to tell one computer book from another, Manning cele- brates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life by pictures from collections such as this one.'},\n",

Once you scratch its surface, you will not only find a programming language with unparalleled speed and safety, but one that is enjoyable enough to use every day.  When you begin to program in Rust, it’s likely that you will want to continue to do so. And this book, Rust in Action, will build your confidence as a Rust program- mer. But it will not teach you how to program from the beginning. This book is intended to be read by people who are considering Rust as their next language and for those who enjoy implementing practical working examples. Here is a list of some of the larger examples this book includes: \\uf0a1Mandelbrot set renderer \\uf0a1A grep clone This chapter covers \\uf0a1Introducing Rust’s features and goals \\uf0a1Exposing Rust’s syntax \\uf0a1Discussing where to use Rust and when to  avoid it \\uf0a1Building your first Rust program \\uf0a1Explaining how Rust compares to object-oriented  and wider languages'},\n",

It also introduces you to systems programming and low-level program- ming. As you work through Rust in Action, you’ll learn about the role of an operating system (OS), how a CPU works, how computers keep time, what pointers are, and what a data type is. You will gain an understanding of how the computer’s internal sys- tems interoperate. Learning more than syntax, you will also see why Rust was created and the challenges that it addresses. 1.1 Where is Rust used? Rust has won the “most loved programming language” award in Stack Overflow’s annual developer survey every year in 2016-2020. Perhaps that’s why large technology leaders such as the following have adopted Rust: \\uf0a1Amazon Web Services (AWS) has used Rust since 2017 for its serverless comput- ing offerings, AWS Lambda and AWS Fargate. With that, Rust has gained fur- ther inroads. The company has written the Bottlerocket OS and the AWS Nitro System to deliver its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service.1 \\uf0a1Cloudflare develops many of its services, including its public DNS, serverless computing, and packet inspection offerings with Rust.2 \\uf0a1Dropbox rebuilt its backend warehouse, which manages exabytes of storage, with Rust.3 \\uf0a1Google develops parts of Android, such as its Bluetooth module, with Rust. Rust is also used for the crosvm component of Chrome OS and plays an important role in Google’s new operating system, Fuchsia.4 \\uf0a1Facebook uses Rust to power Facebook’s web, mobile, and API services, as well as parts of HHVM, the HipHop virtual machine used by the Hack programming language.5 \\uf0a1Microsoft writes components of its Azure platform including a security daemon for its Internet of Things (IoT) service in Rust.6 1 See “How our AWS Rust team will contribute to Rust’s future successes,” http://mng.bz/BR4J. 2 See “Rust at Cloudflare,” https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17077358. 3 See “The Epic Story of Dropbox’s Exodus From the Amazon Cloud Empire,” http://mng.bz/d45Q. 4 See “Google joins the Rust Foundation,” http://mng.bz/ryOX. 5 See “HHVM 4.20.0 and 4.20.1,” https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/08/27/hhvm-4.20.0.html. 6 See https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/tree/master/edgelet.'},\n",

I ran into a similar use case in one of my own projects—a vobsub     subtitle decoder, which parses complicated binary data, and which I     someday want to run as web service.  So obviously, I want to ensure     that there are no vulnerabilities in my code.     I wrote the code in Rust, and then I used \\'cargo fuzz\\' to try and     find vulnerabilities. After running a billion(!) fuzz iterations, I     found 5 bugs (see the \\'vobsub\\' section of the trophy case for a list     https:/ /github.com/rust-fuzz/trophy-case).     Happily, not _one_ of those bugs could actually be escalated into an     actual exploit. In each case, Rust\\'s various runtime checks     successfully caught the problem and turned it into a controlled panic.     (In practice, this would restart the web server cleanly.)     So my takeaway from this was that whenever I want a language (1) with     no GC, but (2) which I can trust in a security-critical context, Rust     is an excellent choice. The fact that I can statically link Linux     binaries (like with Go) is a nice plus.

In each case, Rust\\'s various runtime checks       > successfully caught the problem and turned it into a controlled       > panic.       This has been more or less our experience with fuzzing rust code in       firefox too, fwiw. Fuzzing found a lot of panics (and debug       assertions / \"safe\" overflow assertions). In one case it actually       found a bug that had been under the radar in the analogous Gecko       code for around a decade. From this excerpt, we can see that language adoption has been “bottom up” by engi- neers looking to overcome technical challenges in relatively small projects. Experi- ence gained from these successes is then used as evidence to justify undertaking more ambitious work.  In the time since late 2017, Rust has continued to mature and strengthen. It has become an accepted part of Google’s technology landscape, and is now an officially sanctioned language within the Android and Fuchsia operating systems.  1.3 A taste of the language This section gives you a chance to experience Rust firsthand. It demonstrates how to use the compiler and then moves on to writing a quick program. We tackle full proj- ects in later chapters.

You’ll do that too, but with flair. You’ll verify that everything is in working order before you encounter annoy- ing syntax errors.  If you use Windows, open the Rust command prompt that is available in the Start menu after installing Rust. Then execute this command: C:\\\\> cd %TMP% If you are running Linux or macOS, open a Terminal window. Once open, enter the following: $ cd $TMP  From this point forward, the commands for all operating systems should be the same. If you installed Rust correctly, the following three commands will display “Hello, world!” on the screen (as well as a bunch of other output): $ cargo new hello $ cd hello $ cargo run  Here is an example of what the entire session looks like when running cmd.exe on MS Windows: C:\\\\> cd %TMP%  C:\\\\Users\\\\Tim\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\> cargo new hello       Created binary (application) `hello` project C:\\\\Users\\\\Tim\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\> cd hello  C:\\\\Users\\\\Tim\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\hello\\\\> cargo run     Compiling hello v0.1.0 (file:/ / /C:/Users/Tim/AppData/Local/Temp/hello)     Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32s      Running `target\\\\debug\\\\hello.exe` Hello, world!

You have run your first Rust code without need- ing to write any Rust. Let’s take a look at what just happened.  Rust’s cargo tool provides both a build system and a package manager. That means cargo knows how to convert your Rust code into executable binaries and also can manage the process of downloading and compiling the project’s dependencies.  cargo new creates a project for you that follows a standard template. The tree command can reveal the default project structure and the files that are created after issuing cargo new: $ tree hello  hello ├── Cargo.toml └── src     └── main.rs 1 directory, 2 files All Rust projects created with cargo have the same structure. In the base directory, a file called Cargo.toml describes the project’s metadata, such as the project’s name, its version, and its dependencies. Source code appears in the src directory. Rust source code files use the .rs filename extension. To view the files that cargo new creates, use the tree command.  The next command that you executed was cargo run. This line is much simpler to grasp, but cargo actually did much more work than you realized. You asked cargo to run the project. As there was nothing to actually run when you invoked the command, it decided to compile the code in debug mode on your behalf to provide maximal error information. As it happens, the src/main.rs file always includes a “Hello, world!” stub. The result of that compilation was a file called hello (or hello.exe). The hello file was executed, and the result printed to your screen.  Executing cargo run has also added new files to the project. We now have a Cargo.lock file in the base of our project and a target/ directory. Both that file and the directory are managed by cargo. Because these are artifacts of the compilation process, we won’t need to touch these. Cargo.lock is a file that specifies the exact ver- sion numbers of all the dependencies so that future builds are reliably built the same way until Cargo.toml is modified.  Running tree again reveals the new structure created by invoking cargo run to compile the hello project: $ tree --dirsfirst hello  hello ├── src │   └── main.rs'},\n",

Now that we’ve cheated our way to “Hello, World!”, let’s get there via the long way. 1.3.2 Your first Rust program For our first program, we want to write something that outputs the following text in multiple languages: Hello, world! Grüß Gott! ハロー・ワールド You have probably seen the first line in your travels. The other two are there to high- light a few of Rust’s features: easy iteration and built-in support for Unicode. For this program, we’ll use cargo to create it as before. Here are the steps to follow: 1 Open a console prompt. 2 Run cd %TMP% on MS Windows; otherwise cd $TMP. 3 Run cargo new hello2 to create a new project. 4 Run cd hello2 to move into the project’s root directory. 5 Open the file src/main.rs in a text editor. 6 Replace the text in that file with the text in listing 1.1. The code for the following listing is in the source code repository. Open ch1/ch1- hello2/src/hello2.rs.  1 fn greet_world() {  2     println!(\"Hello, world!\");      3     let southern_germany = \"Grüß Gott!\";     4     let japan = \"ハロー・ワールド\";                  5     let regions = [southern_germany, japan];    6     for region in regions.iter() {              7             println!(\"{}\", &region);      8     }  9 } Listing 1.1 “Hello World!” in three languages The exclamation mark indicates the use of a macro, which we’ll discuss shortly. Assignment in Rust, more  properly called variable  binding, uses the let keyword. Unicode support is  provided out of the box. Array literals use square brackets. Many types can have an iter()  method to return an iterator. The ampersand “borrows”  region for read-only access.'},\n",

Grüß Gott! ハロー・ワールド Let’s take a few moments to touch on some of the interesting elements of Rust from listing 1.2.  One of the first things that you are likely to notice is that strings in Rust are able to include a wide range of characters. Strings are guaranteed to be encoded as UTF-8. This means that you can use non-English languages with relative ease.  The one character that might look out of place is the exclamation mark after println. If you have programmed in Ruby, you may be used to thinking that it is used to signal a destructive operation. In Rust, it signals the use of a macro. Macros can be thought of as fancy functions for now. These offer the ability to avoid boilerplate code. In the case of println!, there is a lot of type detection going on under the hood so that arbitrary data types can be printed to the screen.  1.4 Downloading the book’s source code In order to follow along with the examples in this book, you might want to access the source code for the listings. For your convenience, source code for every example is available from two sources: \\uf0a1https://manning.com/books/rust-in-action \\uf0a1https://github.com/rust-in-action/code 1.5 What does Rust look and feel like? Rust is the programming language that allows Haskell and Java programmers to get along. Rust comes close to the high-level, expressive feel of dynamic languages like Haskell and Java while achieving low-level, bare-metal performance.  We looked at a few “Hello, world!” examples in section 1.3, so let’s try something slightly more complex to get a better feel for Rust’s features. Listing 1.2 provides a quick look at what Rust can do for basic text processing. The source code for this list- ing is in the ch1/ch1-penguins/src/main.rs file. Some features to notice include Calls a function. Note  that parentheses follow  the function name.'},\n",

For example, line 19 (.map(|field| field.trim())) includes a closure, also known as an anonymous function or lambda function. \\uf0a1Type annotations—Although relatively rare, these are occasionally required as a hint to the compiler (for example, see line 27 beginning with if let Ok(length)). \\uf0a1Conditional compilation—In the listing, lines 21–24 (if cfg!(…);) are not included in release builds of the program. \\uf0a1Implicit return—Rust provides a return keyword, but it’s usually omitted. Rust is an expression-based language.  1 fn main() {                   2   let penguin_data = \"\\\\        3   common name,length (cm)  4   Little penguin,33  5   Yellow-eyed penguin,65  6   Fiordland penguin,60  7   Invalid,data  8   \";  9  10   let records = penguin_data.lines(); 11  12   for (i, record) in records.enumerate() { 13     if i == 0 || record.trim().len() == 0 {   14       continue; 15     } 16  17     let fields: Vec<_> = record     18       .split(\\',\\')                    19       .map(|field| field.trim())      20       .collect();                      21     if cfg!(debug_assertions) {          22       eprintln!(\"debug: {:?} -> {:?}\", 23              record, fields);          24     } 25  26     let name = fields[0]; 27     if let Ok(length) = fields[1].parse::<f32>() {     28         println!(\"{}, {}cm\", name, length);      29     } 30   } 31 } Listing 1.2 might be confusing to some readers, especially those who have never seen Rust before.

       "  'text': '10 CHAPTER 1 Introducing Rust \\uf0a1On line 17, the fields variable is annotated with the type Vec<_>. Vec is short- hand for _vector_, a collection type that can expand dynamically. The under- score (_) instructs Rust to infer the type of the elements. \\uf0a1On lines 22 and 28, we instruct Rust to print information to the console. The println! macro prints its arguments to standard out (stdout), whereas eprintln! prints to standard error (stderr). Macros are similar to functions except that instead of returning data, these return code. Macros are often used to simplify common patterns. eprintln! and println! both use a string literal with an embedded mini- language in their first argument to control their output. The {} placeholder tells Rust to use a programmer-defined method to represent the value as a string rather than the default representation available with {:?}. \\uf0a1Line 27 contains some novel features. if let Ok(length) = fields[1].parse ::<f32>() reads as “attempt to parse fields[1] as a 32-bit floating-point num- ber and, if that is successful, then assign the number to the length variable.” The if let construct is a concise method of conditionally processing data that also provides a local variable assigned to that data. The parse() method returns Ok(T) (where T stands for any type) when it can successfully parse the string; otherwise, it returns Err(E) (where E stands for an error type). The effect of if let Ok(T) is to skip any error cases like the one that’s encountered while processing the line Invalid,data. When Rust is unable to infer the types from the surrounding context, it will ask for you to specify those. The call to parse() includes an inline type annota- tion as parse::<f32>(). Converting source code into an executable file is called compiling. To compile Rust code, we need to install the Rust compiler and run it against the source code. To com- pile listing 1.2, follow these steps: 1 Open a console prompt (such as cmd.exe, PowerShell, Terminal, or Alacritty). 2 Move to the ch1/ch1-penguins directory (not ch1/ch1-penguins/src) of the source code you downloaded in section 1.4. 3 Execute cargo run. Its output is shown in the following code snippet: $ cargo run     Compiling ch1-penguins v0.1.0 (../code/ch1/ch1-penguins)     Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.40s      Running `target/debug/ch1-penguins` dbg: \"  Little penguin,33\" -> [\"Little penguin\", \"33\"] Little penguin, 33cm dbg: \"  Yellow-eyed penguin,65\" -> [\"Yellow-eyed penguin\", \"65\"] Yellow-eyed penguin, 65cm dbg: \"  Fiordland penguin,60\" -> [\"Fiordland penguin\", \"60\"] Fiordland penguin, 60cm dbg: \"  Invalid,data\" -> [\"Invalid\", \"data\"]'},\n",

Hopefully these demonstrated that Rust pro- grams have a high-level feel, paired with low-level performance. Let’s take a step back from specific language features now and consider some of the thinking behind the language and where it fits within the programming language ecosystem.  1.6 What is Rust? Rust’s distinguishing feature as a programming language is its ability to prevent invalid data access at compile time. Research projects by Microsoft’s Security Response Center and the Chromium browser project both suggest that issues relating to invalid data access account for approximately 70% of serious security bugs.13 Rust eliminates that class of bugs. It guarantees that your program is memory-safe without imposing any run- time costs.  Other languages can provide this level of safety, but these require adding checks that execute while your program is running, thus slowing it down. Rust manages to break out of this continuum, creating its own space as illustrated by figure 1.1.  Rust’s distinguishing feature as a professional community is its willingness to explicitly include values into its decision-making process. This ethos of inclusion is pervasive. Public messaging is welcoming. All interactions within the Rust community are governed by its code of conduct. Even the Rust compiler’s error messages are ridiculously helpful. 13 See the articles “We need a safer systems programming language,” http://mng.bz/VdN5 and “Memory safety,” http://mng.bz/xm7B for more information.'},\n",

       "  'text': '12 CHAPTER 1 Introducing Rust Until late 2018, visitors to the Rust home page were greeted with the (technically heavy) message, “Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, pre- vents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.” At that point, the community imple- mented a change to its wording to put its users (and its potential users) at the center (table 1.1). Rust is labelled as a systems programming language, which tends to be seen as quite a spe- cialized, almost esoteric branch of programming. However, many Rust programmers have discovered that the language is applicable to many other domains. Safety, pro- ductivity, and control are useful in all software engineering projects. Moreover, the Rust community’s inclusiveness means that the language benefits from a steady stream of new voices with diverse interests.  Let’s flesh out those three goals: safety, productivity, and control. What are these and why do these matter? 1.6.1 Goal of Rust: Safety Rust programs are free from \\uf0a1Dangling pointers—Live references to data that has become invalid over the course of the program (see listing 1.3) Table 1.1 Rust slogans over time. As Rust has developed its confidence, it has increasingly embraced the idea of acting as a facilitator and supporter of everyone wanting to achieve their programming aspirations. Until late 2018 From that point onward “Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly  fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.” “Empowering everyone to build reliable  and efficient software.” Most programming languages operate within this band. Rust provides both safety and control. Python Rust C Safety Control Figure 1.1 Rust provides both safety  and control. Other languages have tended  to trade one against the other.'},\n",

What is integer overflow? Well, integers can only represent a finite set of num- bers; these have a fixed-width in memory. Integer overflow is what happens when the integers hit their limit and flow over to the beginning again.  The following listing shows a dangling pointer. Note that you’ll find this source code in the ch1/ch1-cereals/src/main.rs file.  1 #[derive(Debug)]         2 enum Cereal {             3     Barley, Millet, Rice,  4     Rye, Spelt, Wheat,  5 }  6   7 fn main() {  8     let mut grains: Vec<Cereal> = vec![];     9     grains.push(Cereal::Rye);           10     drop(grains);                   11     println!(\"{:?}\", grains);   12 } Listing 1.3 contains a pointer within grains, which is created on line 8. Vec<Cereal> is implemented with an internal pointer to an underlying array. But the listing does not compile. An attempt to do so triggers an error message that complains about attempting to “borrow” a “moved” value. Learning how to interpret that error mes- sage and to fix the underlying error are topics for the pages to come. Here’s the out- put from attempting to compile the code for listing 1.4: $ cargo run     Compiling ch1-cereals v0.1.0 (/rust-in-action/code/ch1/ch1-cereals) error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `grains`   --> src/main.rs:12:22    | 8  |     let mut grains: Vec<Cereal> = vec![];    |         ------- move occurs because `grains` has type                     `std::vec::Vec<Cereal>`, which does not implement                      the `Copy` trait 9  |     grains.push(Cereal::Rye); 10 |     drop(grains);    |          ------ value moved here 11 | Listing 1.3 Attempting to create a dangling pointer Allows the println! macro  to print the Cereal enum An enum (enumeration) is  a type with a fixed number  of legal variants.

Listing 1.4 shows an example of a data race condition. If you remember, this condi- tion results from the inability to determine how a program behaves from run to run due to changing external factors. You’ll find this code in the ch1/ch1-race/src/ main.rs file.  1 use std::thread;       2 fn main() {  3     let mut data = 100;  4   5     thread::spawn(|| { data = 500; });      6     thread::spawn(|| { data = 1000; });     7     println!(\"{}\", data);  8 } If you are unfamiliar with the term thread, the upshot is that this code is not determin- istic. It’s impossible to know what value data will hold when main() exits. On lines 6 and 7 of the listing, two threads are created by calls to thread::spawn(). Each call takes a closure as an argument, denoted by vertical bars and curly braces (e.g., || {…}). The thread spawned on line 5 is attempting to set the data variable to 500, whereas the thread spawned on line 6 is attempting to set it to 1,000. Because the scheduling of threads is determined by the OS rather than the program, it’s impossible to know if the thread defined first will be the one that runs first.  Attempting to compile listing 1.5 results in a stampede of error messages. Rust does not allow multiple places in an application to have write access to data.

While the language of the error message is filled with jargon (borrow, move, trait, and so on), Rust has protected the programmer from stepping into a trap that many others fall into. And fear not—that jargon will become easier to understand as you work through the first few chapters of this book.  Knowing that a language is safe provides programmers with a degree of liberty. Because they know their program won’t implode, they become much more willing to experiment. Within the Rust community, this liberty has spawned the expression fear- less concurrency. 1.6.2 Goal of Rust: Productivity When given a choice, Rust prefers the option that is easiest for the developer. Many of its more subtle features are productivity boosts. But programmer productivity is a diffi- cult concept to demonstrate through an example in a book.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose. At first, “mismatched types” might feel like a strange error message to encounter. Surely we can test variables for equality against integers.  After some thought, it becomes apparent why the if test receives the wrong type. The if is not receiving an integer. It’s receiving the result of an assignment. In Rust, this is the blank type: (). () is pronounced unit.14  When there is no other meaningful return value, expressions return (). As the fol- lowing shows, adding a second equals sign on line 4 results in a working program that prints a equals ten: 1 fn main() { 2     let a = 10; 3  4     if a == 10 {      5         println!(\"a equals ten\"); 6     } 7 } 14 The name unit reveals some of Rust’s heritage as a descendant of the ML family of programming languages that includes OCaml and F#. The term stems from mathematics. Theoretically, a unit type only has a single value. Compare this with Boolean types that have two values, true or false, or strings that have an infinite number of valid values. Using a valid assignment  operator (==) allows the  program to compile.'},\n",

       "  'text': '18 CHAPTER 1 Introducing Rust Rust has many ergonomic features. It offers generics, sophisticated data types, pattern matching, and closures.15 Those who have worked with other ahead-of-time compila- tion languages are likely to appreciate Rust’s build system and its comprehensive pack- age manager: cargo.  At first glance, we see that cargo is a front end for rustc, the Rust compiler, but cargo provides several additional utilities including the following: \\uf0a1 cargo new creates a skeleton Rust project in a new directory (cargo init uses the current directory). \\uf0a1 cargo build downloads dependencies and compiles the code. \\uf0a1 cargo run executes cargo build and then also runs the resulting executable file. \\uf0a1 cargo doc builds HTML documentation for every dependency in the current project.  1.6.3 Goal of Rust: Control Rust offers programmers fine-grained control over how data structures are laid out in memory and their access patterns. While Rust uses sensible defaults that align with its “zero cost abstractions” philosophy, those defaults do not suit all situations.  At times, it is imperative to manage your application’s performance. It might mat- ter to you that data is stored in the stack rather than on the heap. Perhaps, it might make sense to add reference counting to create a shared reference to a value. Occasion- ally, it might be useful to create one’s own type of pointer for a particular access pat- tern. The design space is large and Rust provides the tools to allow you to implement your preferred solution. NOTE If terms such as stack, heap, and reference counting are new, don’t put the book down! We’ll spend lots of time explaining these and how they work together throughout the rest of the book. Listing 1.7 prints the line a: 10, b: 20, c: 30, d: Mutex { data: 40 }. Each represen- tation is another way to store an integer. As we progress through the next few chap- ters, the trade-offs related to each level become apparent. For the moment, the important thing to remember is that the menu of types is comprehensive. You are wel- come to choose exactly what’s right for your specific use case.  Listing 1.7 also demonstrates multiple ways to create integers. Each form provides differing semantics and runtime characteristics. But programmers retain full control of the trade-offs that they want to make.     15 If these terms are unfamiliar, do keep reading. These are explained throughout the book. They are language features that you will miss in other languages.'},\n",

Safety should be a “zero-cost abstraction.” 1.7 Rust’s big features Our tools shape what we believe we can create. Rust enables you to build the software that you want to make, but were too scared to try. What kind of tool is Rust? Flowing from the three principles discussed in the last section are three overarching features of the language: \\uf0a1Performance \\uf0a1Concurrency \\uf0a1Memory efficiency 1.7.1 Performance Rust offers all of your computer’s available performance. Famously, Rust does not rely on a garbage collector to provide its memory safety.  There is, unfortunately, a problem with promising you faster programs: the speed of your CPU is fixed. Thus, for software to run faster, it needs to do less. Yet, the lan- guage is large. To resolve this conflict, Rust pushes the burden onto the compiler.  The Rust community prefers a bigger language with a compiler that does more, rather than a simpler language where the compiler does less. The Rust compiler aggressively optimizes both the size and speed of your program. Rust also has some less obvious tricks: \\uf0a1Cache-friendly data structures are provided by default. Arrays usually hold data within Rust programs rather than deeply nested tree structures that are created by pointers. This is referred to as data-oriented programming. Listing 1.7 Multiple ways to create integer values Integer on the stack Integer on the heap, also  known as a boxed integer Boxed integer wrapped  within a reference counter Integer wrapped in an atomic  reference counter and protected  by a mutual exclusion lock'},\n",

       "  'text': '20 CHAPTER 1 Introducing Rust \\uf0a1The availability of a modern package manager (cargo) makes it trivial to benefit from tens of thousands of open source packages. C and C++ have much less consistency here, and building large projects with many dependencies is typically difficult. \\uf0a1Methods are always dispatched statically unless you explicitly request dynamic dispatch. This enables the compiler to heavily optimize code, sometimes to the point of eliminating the cost of a function call entirely.  1.7.2 Concurrency Asking a computer to do more than one thing at the same time has proven difficult for software engineers. As far as an OS is concerned, two independent threads of exe- cution are at liberty to destroy each other if a programmer makes a serious mistake. Yet Rust has spawned the expression fearless concurrency. Its emphasis on safety crosses the bounds of independent threads. There is no global interpreter lock (GIL) to con- strain a thread’s speed. We explore some of the implications of this in part 2.  1.7.3 Memory efficiency Rust enables you to create programs that require minimal memory. When needed, you can use fixed-size structures and know exactly how every byte is managed. High- level constructs, such as iteration and generic types, incur minimal runtime overhead.  1.8 Downsides of Rust It’s easy to talk about this language as if it is the panacea for all software engineering. For example \\uf0a1“A high-level syntax with low-level performance!” \\uf0a1“Concurrency without crashes!” \\uf0a1“C with perfect safety!” These slogans (sometimes overstated) are great. But for all of its merits, Rust does have some disadvantages. 1.8.1 Cyclic data structures In Rust, it is difficult to model cyclic data like an arbitrary graph structure. Imple- menting a doubly-linked list is an undergraduate-level computer science problem. Yet Rust’s safety checks do hamper progress here. If you’re new to the language, avoid implementing these sorts of data structures until you’re more familiar with Rust.  1.8.2 Compile times Rust is slower at compiling code than its peer languages. It has a complex compiler toolchain that receives multiple intermediate representations and sends lots of code to the LLVM compiler. The unit of compilation for a Rust program is not an individ- ual file but a whole package (known affectionately as a crate). As crates can include'},\n",

       "  'text': '21 TLS security case studies multiple modules, these can be exceedingly large units to compile. Although this enables whole-of-crate optimization, it requires whole-of-crate compilation as well.  1.8.3 Strictness It’s impossible—well, difficult—to be lazy when programming with Rust. Programs won’t compile until everything is just right. The compiler is strict, but helpful.  Over time, it’s likely that you’ll come to appreciate this feature. If you’ve ever pro- grammed in a dynamic language, then you may have encountered the frustration of your program crashing because of a misnamed variable. Rust brings that frustration forward so that your users don’t have to experience the frustration of things crashing.  1.8.4 Size of the language Rust is large! It has a rich type system, several dozen keywords, and includes some fea- tures that are unavailable in other languages. These factors all combine to create a steep learning curve. To make this manageable, I encourage learning Rust gradually. Start with a minimal subset of the language and give yourself time to learn the details when you need these. That is the approach taken in this book. Advanced concepts are deferred until much later.  1.8.5 Hype The Rust community is wary of growing too quickly and being consumed by hype. Yet, a number of software projects have encountered this question in their Inbox: “Have you considered rewriting this in Rust?” Unfortunately, software written in Rust is still software. It not immune to security problems and does not offer a panacea to all of software engineering’s ills.  1.9 TLS security case studies To demonstrate that Rust will not alleviate all errors, let’s examine two serious exploits that threatened almost all internet-facing devices and consider whether Rust would have prevented those.  By 2015, as Rust gained prominence, implementations of SSL/TLS (namely, OpenSSL and Apple’s own fork) were found to have serious security holes. Known informally as Heartbleed and goto fail;, both exploits provide opportunities to test Rust’s claims of memory safety. Rust is likely to have helped in both cases, but it is still possi- ble to write Rust code that suffers from similar issues. 1.9.1 Heartbleed Heartbleed, officially designated as CVE-2014-0160,16 was caused by re-using a buffer incorrectly. A buffer is a space set aside in memory for receiving input. Data can leak from one read to the next if the buffer’s contents are not cleared between writes. 16 See “CVE-2014-0160 Detail,” https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160.'},\n",

       "  'text': '22 CHAPTER 1 Introducing Rust  Why does this situation occur? Programmers hunt for performance. Buffers are reused to minimize how often memory applications ask for memory from the OS.  Imagine that we want to process some secret information from multiple users. We decide, for whatever reason, to reuse a single buffer through the course of the pro- gram. If we don’t reset this buffer once we use it, information from earlier calls will leak to the latter ones. Here is a précis of a program that would encounter this error: let buffer = &mut[0u8; 1024];   read_secrets(&user1, buffer);     store_secrets(buffer); read_secrets(&user2, buffer);    store_secrets(buffer); Rust does not protect you from logical errors. It ensures that your data is never able to be written in two places at the same time. It does not ensure that your program is free from all security issues.  1.9.2 Goto fail; The goto fail; bug, officially designated as CVE-2014-1266,17 was caused by program- mer error coupled with C design issues (and potentially by its compiler not pointing out the flaw). A function that was designed to verify a cryptographic key pair ended up skipping all checks.

C compilers interpret those three lines like this:     if ((err = SSLHashSHA1.update(&hashCtx, &signedParams)) != 0) {         goto fail;     }     goto fail; Would Rust have helped? Probably. In this specific case, Rust’s grammar would have caught the bug. It does not allow logical tests without curly braces. Rust also issues a warning when code is unreachable. But that doesn’t mean the error is made impossi- ble in Rust. Stressed programmers under tight deadlines make mistakes. In general, similar code would compile and run. TIP Code with caution.  1.10 Where does Rust fit best? Although it was designed as a systems programming language, Rust is a general-purpose language. It has been successfully deployed in many areas, which we discuss next. 1.10.1 Command-line utilities Rust offers three main advantages for programmers creating command-line utilities: minimal startup time, low memory use, and easy deployment. Programs start their work quickly because Rust does not need to initialize an interpreter (Python, Ruby, etc.) or virtual machine (Java, C#, etc.). Unconditional goto skips SSLHashSHA1.final()  and the (significant) call to sslRawVerify(). Returns the pass value of 0, even for inputs  that should have failed the verification test'},\n",

       "  'text': '24 CHAPTER 1 Introducing Rust  As a bare metal language, Rust produces memory-efficient programs.19 As you’ll see throughout the book, many types are zero-sized. That is, these only exist as hints to the compiler and take up no memory at all in the running program.  Utilities written in Rust are compiled as static binaries by default. This compilation method avoids depending on shared libraries that you must install before the pro- gram can run. Creating programs that can run without installation steps makes these easy to distribute.  1.10.2 Data processing Rust excels at text processing and other forms of data wrangling. Programmers bene- fit from control over memory use and fast startup times. As of mid-2017, Rust touts the world’s fastest regular expression engine. In 2019, the Apache Arrow data-processing project—foundational to the Python and R data science ecosystems—accepted the Rust-based DataFusion project.  Rust also underlies the implementation of multiple search engines, data-processing engines, and log-parsing systems. Its type system and memory control provide you with the ability to create high throughput data pipelines with a low and stable memory footprint. Small filter programs can be easily embedded into the larger framework via Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, or Apache Hadoop streaming.  1.10.3 Extending applications Rust is well suited for extending programs written in a dynamic language. This enables JNI (Java Native Interface) extensions, C extensions, or Erlang/Elixir NIFs (native implemented functions) in Rust. C extensions are typically a scary proposition. These tend to be quite tightly integrated with the runtime. Make a mistake and you could be looking at runaway memory consumption due to a memory leak or a com- plete crash. Rust takes away a lot of this anxiety. \\uf0a1Sentry, a company that processes application errors, finds that Rust is an excellent candidate for rewriting CPU-intensive components of their Python system.20 \\uf0a1Dropbox used Rust to rewrite the file synchronization engine of its client-side application: “More than performance, [Rust’s] ergonomics and focus on cor- rectness have helped us tame sync’s complexity.”21 1.10.4 Resource-constrained environments C has occupied the domain of microcontrollers for decades. Yet, the Internet of Things (IoT) is coming. That could mean many billions of insecure devices exposed to the network. Any input parsing code will be routinely probed for weaknesses. Given how infrequently firmware updates for these devices occur, it’s critical that these are as 19 The joke goes that Rust is as close to bare metal as possible. 20 See “Fixing Python Performance with Rust,” http://mng.bz/ryxX. 21 See “Rewriting the heart of our sync engine,” http://mng.bz/Vdv5.'},\n",

Rust can play an important role here by adding a layer of safety without imposing runtime costs.  1.10.5 Server-side applications Most applications written in Rust live on the server. These could be serving web traffic or supporting businesses running their operations. There is also a tier of services that sit between the OS and your application. Rust is used to write databases, monitoring systems, search appliances, and messaging systems. For example \\uf0a1The npm package registry for the JavaScript and node.js communities is written in Rust.22 \\uf0a1sled (https://github.com/spacejam/sled), an embedded database, can process a workload of 1 billion operations that includes 5% writes in less than a minute on a 16-core machine. \\uf0a1Tantivy, a full text search engine, can index 8 GB of English Wikipedia in approximately 100 s on a 4-core desktop machine.23 1.10.6 Desktop applications There is nothing inherent in Rust’s design that prevents it from being deployed to develop user-facing software. Servo, the web browser engine that acted as an incuba- tor for Rust’s early development, is a user-facing application. Naturally, so are games. 1.10.7 Desktop There is still a significant need to write applications that live on people’s computers. Desktop applications are often complex, difficult to engineer, and hard to support. With Rust’s ergonomic approach to deployment and its rigor, it is likely to become the secret sauce for many applications. To start, these will be built by small, independent developers. As Rust matures, so will the ecosystem.  1.10.8 Mobile Android, iOS, and other smartphone operating systems generally provide a blessed path for developers. In the case of Android, that path is Java. In the case of macOS, developers generally program in Swift. There is, however, another way.  Both platforms provide the ability for native applications to run on them. This is generally intended for applications written in C++, such as games, to be able to be deployed to people’s phones. Rust is able to talk to the phone via the same interface with no additional runtime cost.  22 See “Community makes Rust an easy choice for npm: The npm Registry uses Rust for its CPU-bound bottle- necks,” http://mng.bz/xm9B. 23 See “Of tantivy’s indexing,” https://fulmicoton.com/posts/behold-tantivy-part2/.'},\n",

Browser vendors are developing a standard called WebAssembly (Wasm) that promises to be a compiler target for many languages. Rust is one of the first. Porting a Rust project to the browser requires only two additional command-line commands. Several companies are exploring the use of Rust in the browser via Wasm, notably CloudFlare and Fastly.  1.10.10 Systems programming In some sense, systems programming is Rust’s raison d’être. Many large programs have been implemented in Rust, including compilers (Rust itself), video game engines, and operating systems. The Rust community includes writers of parser generators, databases, and file formats.  Rust has proven to be a productive environment for programmers who share Rust’s goals.

One of the things that the Rust team has done extraordinarily well is to foster a positive and welcoming com- munity around the language. Everywhere you go within the Rust world, you’ll find that you’ll be treated with courtesy and respect.  1.12 Rust phrase book When you interact with members of the Rust community, you’ll soon encounter a few terms that have special meaning. Understanding the following terms makes it easier to understand why Rust has evolved the way that it has and the problems that it attempts to solve: \\uf0a1Empowering everyone—All programmers regardless of ability or background are welcome to participate. Programming, and particularly systems programming, should not be restricted to a blessed few. 24 See “Welcome to Fuchsia!,” https://fuchsia.dev/. 25 See “Using Rust in Windows,” http://mng.bz/A0vW. 26 See “Bottlerocket: Linux-based operating system purpose-built to run containers,” https://aws.amazon.com/ bottlerocket/.'},\n",

You’ll be able to write pro- grams that match or exceed the performance of its peer languages, but you will have more safety guarantees. \\uf0a1Fearless concurrency—Concurrent and parallel programming have always been seen as difficult. Rust frees you from whole classes of errors that have plagued its peer languages. \\uf0a1No Rust 2.0—Rust code written today will always compile with a future Rust compiler. Rust is intended to be a reliable programming language that can be depended upon for decades to come. In accordance with semantic versioning, Rust is never backward-incompatible, so it will never release a new major ver- sion. \\uf0a1Zero-cost abstractions—The features you gain from Rust impose no runtime cost. When you program in Rust, safety does not sacrifice speed.  Summary \\uf0a1Many companies have successfully built large software projects in Rust. \\uf0a1Software written in Rust can be compiled for the PC, the browser, and the server, as well as mobile and IoT devices. \\uf0a1The Rust language is well loved by software developers. It has repeatedly won Stack Overflow’s “most loved programming language” title. \\uf0a1Rust allows you to experiment without fear. It provides correctness guarantees that other tools are unable to provide without imposing runtime costs. \\uf0a1With Rust, there are three main command_line tools to learn: – cargo, which manages a whole crate – rustup, which manages Rust installations – rustc, which manages compilation of Rust source code \\uf0a1Rust projects are not immune from all bugs. \\uf0a1Rust code is stable, fast, and light on resources.'},\n",

That is the magic of a programming language. This chapter’s aim is to allow you to become familiar with the process of converting Rust source code into a running program.  Understanding this process is more fun than it sounds! And it sets you up for an exciting learning journey. By the end of chapter 4, you will have implemented a vir- tual CPU that can also interpret programs that you create. 2.1.1 Compiling single files with rustc Listing 2.1 is a short, yet complete Rust program. To translate it into a working pro- gram, we use software called a compiler. The compiler’s role is to translate the source code into machine code, as well as take care of lots of bookkeeping to satisfy the oper- ating system (OS) and CPU that it is a runnable program. The Rust compiler is called rustc. You’ll find the source code for listing 2.1 in the file ch2/ok.rs.  1 fn main() {  2   println!(\"OK\")  3 } To compile a single file written in Rust into a working program 1 Save your source code to a file. In our case, we’ll use the filename ok.rs. 2 Make sure that the source code includes a main() function. 3 Open a shell window such as Terminal, cmd.exe, Powershell, bash, zsh, or any other. 4 Execute the command rustc <file>, where <file> is the file you want to compile. When compilation succeeds, rustc sends no output to the console. Behind the scenes, rustc has dutifully created an executable, using the input filename to choose the out- put filename.  Assuming that you’ve saved listing 2.1 to a file called ok.rs, let’s see what that looks like. The following snippet provides a short demonstration of the process: $ rustc ok.rs  $ ./ok         OK 2.1.2 Compiling Rust projects with cargo Most Rust projects are larger than a single file. These typically include dependencies. To prepare ourselves for that, we’ll use a higher-level tool than rustc, called cargo. cargo understands how to drive rustc (and much more).

The first is to move that original file into an empty directory. Then execute the cargo init command.  Here is a detailed overview of that process, assuming that you are starting from a file called ok.rs generated by following the steps in the previous section: 1 Run mkdir <project> to create an empty directory (e.g., mkdir ok). 2 Move your source code into the <project> directory (e.g., mv ok.rs ok). 3 Change to the <project> directory (e.g., cd ok). 4 Run cargo init. From this point on, you can issue cargo run to execute your project’s source code. One difference from rustc is that compiled executables are found in a <project>/ target subdirectory. Another is that cargo provides much more output by default: $ cargo run      Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.03s     Running `target/debug/ok` OK If you’re ever curious about what cargo is doing under the hood to drive rustc, add the verbose flag (-v) to your command: $ rm -rf target/         $ cargo run -v     Compiling ok v0.1.0 (/tmp/ok)      Running `rustc      --crate-name ok      --edition=2018      ok.rs      --error-format=json      --json=diagnostic-rendered-ansi      --crate-type bin      --emit=dep-info,link      -C embed-bitcode=no      -C debuginfo=2      -C metadata=55485250d3e77978      -C extra-filename=-55485250d3e77978      --out-dir /tmp/ok/target/debug/deps      -C incremental=/tmp/target/debug/incremental      -L dependency=/tmp/ok/target/debug/deps      -C link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld`     Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s      Running `target/debug/ok` OK 2.2 A glance at Rust’s syntax Rust is boring and predictable where possible. It has variables, numbers, functions, and other familiar things that you have seen in other languages.

       "  'text': '35 A glance at Rust’s syntax 2.2.1 Defining variables and calling functions Let’s look at another short listing to introduce some fundamentals: defining variables with type annotations and calling functions. Listing 2.2 prints a + b = 30 to the con- sole. As you can see from lines 2–5 in the listing, there are multiple syntactic choices for annotating data types to integers. Use whichever feels most natural for the situa- tion at hand. The source code for this listing is in ch2/ch2-first-steps.rs.  1 fn main() {      2   let a = 10;       3   let b: i32 = 20;       4   let c = 30i32;         5   let d = 30_i32;             6   let e = add(add(a, b), add(c, d));  7   8   println!(\"( a + b ) + ( c + d ) = {}\", e);  9 } 10  11 fn add(i: i32, j: i32) -> i32 {     12   i + j      13 } NOTE In the listing, be careful about adding a semicolon to the add() function declaration. This changes the semantics, returning () (unit) rather than i32. Although there are only 13 lines of code, there is quite a lot packed into listing 2.2. Here’s a brief description that should provide the gist of what’s going on. We will cover the details in the rest of the chapter.  In line 1 (fn main() {), the fn keyword begins a function definition. The entry point to all Rust programs is main(). It takes no arguments and returns no value.1 Code blocks, also known as lexical scopes, are defined with curly braces: { and }.  In line 2 (let a = 10;), we use let to declare variable bindings. Variables are immutable by default, meaning that they are read-only rather than read-write. And finally, statements are delimited with semicolons (;).  In line 3 (let b: i32 = 20;), you can designate a specific data type for the com- piler. At times, this will be required as the compiler will be unable to deduce a unique type on your behalf.  In line 4 (let c = 30i32;), you’ll note that Rust’s numeric literals can include types annotations. This can be helpful when navigating complex numerical expressions. And Listing 2.2 Adding integers using variables and declaring types 1 This isn’t technically correct, but is accurate enough for now. If you’re an experienced Rust programmer skim- ming through this chapter, you’ll know that main() returns () (unit) by default and can also return a Result. Rust is flexible with the location of the main() function. Types can be inferred  by the compiler… …or declared by the programmer  when creating variables. Numeric types can include a type  annotation in their literal form. Numbers can include underscores,  which are intended to increase  readability and have no functional  impact. Type declarations are required  when defining functions. Functions return the last  expression’s result so that  return is not required.'},\n",

       "  'text': '36 CHAPTER 2 Language foundations in line 5 (let c = 30_i32;), you’ll see that Rust permits the use of underscores within numeric literals. These increase readability but are insignificant to the compiler. In line 6 (let e = add(add(a, b), add(c, d));), it should be easy to see that calling func- tions looks like what you’ve experienced in most other programming languages.  In line 8 (println!(\"( a + b ) + ( c + d ) = {}\", e); ), println!() is a macro, which is function-like but returns code rather than values. When printing to the con- sole, every input data type has its own way of being represented as a text string. println!() takes care of figuring out the exact methods to call on its arguments.  Strings use double quotes (\") rather than single quotes (\\'). Rust uses single quotes for single characters, which are a distinct type, char. And with Rust, string formatting uses {} as a placeholder, rather than the C-like printf style of %s or other variants.  Finally, in line 10 (fn add(…) -> i32 {), you can see that Rust’s syntax for defining functions is similar to those programming languages that use explicit type declara- tions. Commas delimit parameters, and type declarations follow variable names. The dagger (->) or thin arrow syntax indicates the return type.  2.3 Numbers Computers have been associated with numbers for longer than you have been able to say “formula translator.” This section discusses how to create numeric types in Rust and how to perform operations on these. 2.3.1 Integers and decimal (floating-point) numbers Rust uses a relatively conventional syntax for creating integers (1, 2, …) and floating- point numbers (1.0, 1.1, …). Operations on numbers use infix notation, meaning that numeric expressions look like those that you’re used to seeing in most programming lan- guages. To operate on multiple types, Rust also allows the same token (+) for addition. This is called operator overloading. Some notable differences from other languages follow: \\uf0a1Rust includes a large number of numeric types. You will become used to declaring the size in bytes, which affects how many numbers the type can represent and whether your type is able to represent negative numbers. \\uf0a1Conversions between types are always explicit. Rust does not automatically convert your 16-bit integer into a 32-bit integer. \\uf0a1Rust’s numbers can have methods. For example, to round 24.5 to the nearest inte- ger, Rust programmers use 24.5_f32.round() rather than (round(24.5_f32)). Here, the type suffix is required because a concrete type is necessary. To start, let’s consider a small example. You’ll find the code in ch2/ch2-intro-to- numbers.rs in the examples for this book.

This notation is also avail- able within the formatting macros like println!. Listing 2.4 demonstrates the three styles. You can find the source code for this listing in ch2/ch2-non-base2.rs. It pro- duces the following output: base 10: 3 30 300 base 2:  11 11110 100101100 base 8:  3 36 454 base 16: 3 1e 12c  1 fn main() {  2   let three = 0b11;     3   let thirty = 0o36;             4   let three_hundred = 0x12C;     5   6   println!(\"base 10: {} {} {}\", three, thirty, three_hundred);  7   println!(\"base 2:  {:b} {:b} {:b}\", three, thirty, three_hundred);  8   println!(\"base 8:  {:o} {:o} {:o}\", three, thirty, three_hundred);  9   println!(\"base 16: {:x} {:x} {:x}\", three, thirty, three_hundred); 10 } Listing 2.3 Numeric literals and basic operations on numbers in Rust Listing 2.4 Using base 2, base 8, and base 16 numeric literals Rust infers a type  on your behalf if you  don’t supply one… …which is done  by adding type  annotations  (i32)… …or type suffixes.

And with hexadecimal (base 16) numerals, 0x12C equals 300 because 300 = 256 × 1 + 16 × 2 + 1 × 12. Table 2.1 shows the types that represent scalar numbers. Rust contains a full complement of numeric types. The types are grouped into a few families: \\uf0a1Signed integers (i) represent negative as well as positive integers. \\uf0a1Unsigned integers (u) only represent positive integers but can go twice as high as their signed counterparts. \\uf0a1Floating-point types (f) represent real numbers with special bit patterns to rep- resent infinity, negative infinity, and “not a number” values. Integer width is the number of bits that the type uses in RAM and in the CPU. Types that take up more space, such as u32 vs. i8, can represent a wider range of numbers. But this incurs the expense of needing to store extra zeros for smaller numbers, as table 2.2 shows. Although we’ve only touched on numbers, we nearly have enough exposure to Rust to create a prototype of our pattern-matching program. But let’s look at comparing numbers before we create our program.  2.3.3 Comparing numbers Rust’s numeric types support a large suite of comparisons that you’re probably famil- iar with. Enabling support for these comparisons is provided by a feature that you have not encountered yet. It is called traits.2 Table 2.3 summarizes the comparison operators available to you. Table 2.1 Rust types for representing scalar (single) numbers i8, i16, i32, i64 Signed integers ranging from 8 bit to 64 bit. u8, u16, u32, u64 Unsigned integers ranging from 8 bit to 64 bit. f32, f64 Floating-point numbers in 32-bit and 64-bit variants. isize, usize Integers that assume the CPU’s “native” width. For example, in 64-bit CPUs,  usize and isize will be 64-bits wide. Table 2.2 Multiple bit patterns can represent the same number.

       "  'text': '39 Numbers That support does include a few caveats. We’ll look at these conditions in the rest of this section. IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPARE DIFFERENT TYPES Rust’s type safety requirements prevent comparisons between types. For example, this code does not compile:  fn main() {    let a: i32 = 10;    let b: u16 = 100;      if a < b {      println!(\"Ten is less than one hundred.\");    }  } To appease the compiler, we need to use an as operator to cast one of the operands to the other’s type. The following code shows this type cast: b as i32:  fn main() {    let a: i32 = 10;    let b: u16 = 100;      if a < (b as i32) {      println!(\"Ten is less than one hundred.\");    }  } It is safest to cast the smaller type to a larger one (for example, a 16-bit type to a 32-bit type). This is sometimes referred to as promotion. In this case, we could have demoted a down to a u16, but such a move is generally more risky. WARNING Using type casts carelessly will cause your program to behave unex- pectedly. For example, the expression 300_i32 as i8 returns 44. In some cases, using the as keyword is too restrictive. It’s possible to regain fuller con- trol over the type conversion process at the cost of introducing some bureaucracy.

On line 1, the use keyword brings the std::convert::TryInto trait into local scope. This unlocks the try_into() method of the b variable. We’ll bypass a full explanation of why this occurs for now. In the meantime, consider a trait as a collection of methods. If you are from an object-oriented background, traits can be thought of as abstract classes or inter- faces. If your programming experience is in functional languages, you can think of traits as type classes.  Line 7 provides a glimpse of error handling in Rust. b.try_into() returns an i32 value wrapped within a Result. Result is introduced properly in chapter 3. It can contain either a success value or an error value. The unwrap() method can handle the success value and returns the value of b as an i32 here. If the conversion between u16 and i32 were to fail, then calling unsafe() would crash the program. As the book progresses, you will learn safer ways of dealing with Result rather than risking the program’s stability!  A distinguishing characteristic of Rust is that it only allows a type’s methods to be called when the trait is within local scope. An implicit prelude enables common oper- ations such as addition and assignment to be used without explicit imports. TIP To understand what is included in local scope by default, you should investigate the std::prelude module. Its documentation is available online at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html. Listing 2.5 The try_into() method converts between types Floating-point hazards Floating-point types (f32 and f64, for example) can cause serious errors for the unwary. There are (at least) two reasons for this: \\uf0a1These often approximate the numbers that they’re representing. Floating-point types are implemented in base 2, but we often want to calculate numbers in Enables try_into() to be  called on those types that have  implemented it (such as u16) try_into() returns a Result  type that provides access to  the conversion attempt.'},\n",

Representing all of the reals would require infinite precision. \\uf0a1These can represent values that have unintuitive semantics. Unlike integers, floating-point types have some values that do not play well together (by design). Formally, these only have a partial equivalence relation. This is encoded in Rust’s type system. f32 and f64 types only implement the std::cmp::PartialEq trait, whereas other numeric types also implement std::cmp::Eq. To prevent these hazards, here are two guidelines to follow: \\uf0a1Avoid testing floating-point numbers for equality. \\uf0a1Be wary when results may be mathematically undefined. Using equality to compare floating-point numbers can be highly problematic. Floating- point numbers are implemented by computing systems that use binary (base 2) math- ematics, but are often asked to perform operations on decimal (base 10) numbers. This poses a problem because many values we care about, such as 0.1, have no exact representation in binary.a To illustrate the problem, consider the following snippet. Should it run successfully, or should it crash? Although the expression that is being evaluated (0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3) is a mathematical tautology, it crashes on most systems that run it: fn main() {   assert!(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);    } But not all. It turns out that the data type can affect whether the program succeeds or fails. The following code, available at ch2/ch2-add-floats.rs, interrogates the inter- nal bit patterns of each value to find where the differences lie. It then performs the test in the previous example against both f32 and f64 types. Only one test passes:  1 fn main() {  2     let abc: (f32, f32, f32) = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3);  3     let xyz: (f64, f64, f64) = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3);  4   5     println!(\"abc (f32)\");  6     println!(\"   0.1 + 0.2: {:x}\", (abc.0 + abc.1).to_bits());  7     println!(\"         0.3: {:x}\", (abc.2).to_bits());  8     println!();  9  10     println!(\"xyz (f64)\"); 11     println!(\"   0.1 + 0.2: {:x}\", (xyz.0 + xyz.1).to_bits()); 12     println!(\"         0.3: {:x}\", (xyz.2).to_bits()); 13     println!(); 14  15     assert!(abc.0 + abc.1 == abc.2);    16     assert!(xyz.0 + xyz.1 == xyz.2);     17 } assert! crashes the program  unless its argument evaluates  to true.

This margin is often referred to as the epsilon. Rust includes some tolerances to allow comparisons between floating-point values. These tolerances are defined as f32::EPSILON and f64::EPSILON. To be more pre- cise, it’s possible to get closer to how Rust is behaving under the hood, as the fol- lowing small example shows: fn main() {   let result: f32 = 0.1 + 0.1;   let desired: f32 = 0.2;   let absolute_difference = (desired - result).abs();   assert!(absolute_difference <= f32::EPSILON); } In the example, what actually happens is interesting, but mostly irrelevant. The Rust compiler actually delegates the comparison to the CPU. Floating-point operations are implemented using bespoke hardware within the chip.b Operations that produce mathematically undefined results, such as taking the square root of a negative number (-42.0.sqrt()), present particular problems. Floating- point types include “not a number” values (represented in Rust syntax as NAN values) to handle these cases. NAN values poison other numbers. Almost all operations interacting with NAN return NAN. Another thing to be mindful of is that, by definition, NAN values are never equal. This small program will always crash: fn main() {   let x = (-42.0_f32).sqrt();   assert_eq!(x, x); }\"},\n",

It excludes numeric types that are often available within other languages. These include \\uf0a1Many mathematical objects for working with rational numbers and complex numbers \\uf0a1Arbitrary size integers and arbitrary precision floating-point numbers for work- ing with very large or very small numbers \\uf0a1Fixed-point decimal numbers for working with currencies To access these specialized numeric types, you can use the num crate. Crates are Rust’s name for packages. Open source crates are shared at the https://crates.io repository, which is where cargo downloads num from.  Listing 2.6 demonstrates adding two complex numbers together. If you’re unfamil- iar with the term complex numbers, these are two-dimensional, whereas numbers that you deal with day to day are one-dimensional. Complex numbers have “real” and “imagi- nary” parts and are denoted as <real> + <imaginary>i.3 For example, 2.1 + –1.2i is a single complex number. That’s enough mathematics. Let’s look at the code.  Here is the recommended workflow to compile and run listing 2.6: 1 Execute the following commands in a terminal: git clone --depth=1 https:/ /github.com/rust-in-action/code rust-in-action cd rust-in-action/ch2/ch2-complex cargo run 2 For those readers who prefer to learn by doing everything by hand, the follow- ing instructions will achieve the same end result: a Execute the following commands in a terminal: cargo new ch2-complex cd ch2-complex To program defensively, make use of the is_nan() and is_finite() methods. Induc- ing a crash, rather than silently proceeding with a mathematical error, allows you to debug close to what has caused the problem. The following illustrates using the is_finite() method to bring about this condition: fn main() {   let x: f32 = 1.0 / 0.0;   assert!(x.is_finite()); } a If this is confusing to think about, consider that many values, such as 1/3 (one third), have no  exact representation within the decimal number system. b Illegal or undefined operations trigger a CPU exception.

That section will look like this: [dependencies] num = \"0.4\" c Replace src/main.rs with the source code from listing 2.6 (available at ch2/ ch2-complex/src/main.rs). d Execute cargo run.

In our case, only a single type is required: Complex. \\uf0a1Rust does not have constructors; instead, every type has a literal form. You can initialize types by using the type name (Complex) and assigning their fields (re, im) val- ues (such as 2.1 or –1.2) within curly braces ({ }). \\uf0a1Many types implement a new() method for simplicity. This convention, however, is not part of the Rust language. \\uf0a1To access fields, Rust programmers use the dot operator (.). For example, the num:: complex::Complex type has two fields: re represents the real part, and im rep- resents the imaginary part. Both are accessible with the dot operator. Listing 2.6 also introduces some new commands. It demonstrates two forms of initial- izing non-primitive data types.  One is a literal syntax available as part of the Rust language (line 4). The other is the new() static method, which is implemented by convention only and isn’t defined as part of the language (line 5). A static method is a function that’s available for a type, but it’s not an instance of that type.4 Listing 2.6 Calculating values with complex numbers 4 Although Rust is not object-oriented (it’s impossible to create a subclass, for example), Rust makes use of some terminology from that domain.

We’ve now addressed how to access built-in numeric types and types available from third-party libraries. We’ll move on to discussing some more of Rust’s features.  2.4 Flow control Programs execute from top to bottom, except when you don’t want that. Rust has a useful set of flow control mechanisms to facilitate this. This section provides a brief tour of the fundamentals. 2.4.1 For: The central pillar of iteration The for loop is the workhorse of iteration in Rust. Iterating through collections of things, including iterating over collections that may have infinitely many values, is easy. The basic form is for item in container {   // ... } This basic form makes each successive element in container available as item. In this way, Rust emulates many dynamic languages with an easy-to-use, high-level syntax. However, it does have some pitfalls.  Counterintuitively, once the block ends, accessing the container another time becomes invalid. Even though the container variable remains within local scope, its lifetime has ended. For reasons that are explained in chapter 4, Rust assumes that con- tainer is no longer needed once the block finishes. Shortcut for adding a third-party dependency to a project I recommend that you install the cargo-edit crate to enable the cargo add subcom- mand. You can do this with the following code: $ cargo install cargo-edit      Updating crates.io index   Installing cargo-edit v0.6.0   ...   Installed package `cargo-edit v0.6.0` (executables `cargo-add`,     `cargo-rm`, `cargo-upgrade`) Up to this point, we have manually added dependencies to Cargo.toml. The cargo add command simplifies this process by editing the file correctly on your behalf: $ cargo add num      Updating 'https:/ /github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index' index       Adding num v0.4.0 to dependencies\"},\n",

       "  'text': '46 CHAPTER 2 Language foundations  When you want to reuse container later in your program, use a reference. Again, for reasons that are explained in chapter 4, when a reference is omitted, Rust assumes that container is no longer needed. To add a reference to the container, prefix it with an ampersand (&) as this example shows: for item in &container {   // ... } If you need to modify each item during the loop, you can use a mutable reference by including the mut keyword: for item in &mut collection {   // ... } As an implementation detail, Rust’s for loop construct is expanded to method calls by the compiler. As the following table shows, these three forms of for each map to a dif- ferent method. ANONYMOUS LOOPS When a local variable is not used within a block, by convention, you’ll use an under- score (_). Using this pattern in conjunction with the _exclusive range syntax_ (n..m) and the inclusive range syntax (n..=m) makes it clear that the intent is to perform a loop for a fixed number of times. Here’s an example: for _ in 0..10 {   // ... } AVOID MANAGING AN INDEX VARIABLE In many programming languages, it’s common to loop through things by using a tem- porary variable that’s incremented at the end of each iteration. Conventionally, this variable is named i (for index). A Rust version of that pattern is let collection = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; for i in 0..collection.len() {   let item = collection[i];   // ... } Shorthand Equivalent to Access for item in collection for item in  IntoIterator::into_iter(collection) Ownership for item in &collection for item in collection.iter() Read-only for item in &mut collection for item in collection.iter_mut() Read-write'},\n",

       "  'text': '47 Flow control This is legal Rust. It’s also essential in cases when iterating directly over collection via for item in collection is impossible. However, it is generally discouraged. The man- ual approach introduces two problems with this: \\uf0a1Performance—Indexing values with the collection[index] syntax incurs run- time costs for bounds checking. That is, Rust checks that index currently exists within collection as valid data. Those checks are not necessary when iterating directly over collection. The compiler can use compile-time analysis to prove that illegal access is impossible. \\uf0a1Safety—Periodically accessing collection over time introduces the possibility that it has changed. Using a for loop over collection directly allows Rust to guarantee that the collection remains untouched by other parts of the program.  2.4.2 Continue: Skipping the rest of the current iteration The continue keyword operates as you would expect. Here’s an example: for n in 0..10 {   if n % 2 == 0 {     continue;   }   // ... } 2.4.3 While: Looping until a condition changes its state The while loop proceeds as long as a condition holds. The condition, formally known as a predicate, can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. This (non-functioning) snippet takes air quality samples, checking to avoid anomalies: let mut samples = vec![]; while samples.len() < 10 {   let sample = take_sample();   if is_outlier(sample) {     continue;   }   samples.push(sample); } USING WHILE TO STOP ITERATING ONCE A DURATION IS REACHED Listing 2.7 (source code available at ch2/ch2-while-true-incr-count.rs) provides a working example of while.

The preferred alternative is to use the loop keyword, explained in the next section.  while true {   println!(\"Are we there yet?\"); } 2.4.4 Loop: The basis for Rust’s looping constructs Rust contains a loop keyword for providing more control than for and while. loop executes a code block again and again, never stopping for a tea (or coffee) break. loop continues to execute until a break keyword is encountered or the program is ter- minated from the outside. Here’s an example showing the loop syntax: loop {   // ... } loop is often seen when implementing long-running servers, as the following example shows: loop {   let requester, request = accept_request();   let result = process_request(request);   send_response(requester, result); } 2.4.5 Break: Aborting a loop The break keyword breaks out of a loop. In this regard, Rust’s generally operates as you are used to: for (x, y) in (0..).zip(0..) {   if x + y > 100 {     break;   } Listing 2.7 Testing how fast your computer can increment a counter This form of an import hasn’t been seen  before.

The goto keyword can make control flow confusing, and its use is generally discouraged. One place where it is still commonly used, though, is to jump to and clean up a section of a function when an error condition is detected. Use loop labels to enable that pattern.  2.4.6 If, if else, and else: Conditional branching So far, we’ve indulged in the exciting pursuit of looking for numbers within lists of numbers. Our tests have involved utilizing the if keyword. Here’s an example: if item == 42 {   // ... } if accepts any expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (e.g., true or false). When you want to test multiple expressions, it’s possible to add a chain of if else blocks. The else block matches anything that has not already been matched.

Other languages allow special values such as 0 or an empty string to stand in for false and for other values to represent true, but Rust doesn’t allow this. The only value that can be used for true is true, and for false, use false. Rust is an expression-based language In programming languages from this heritage, all expressions return values and almost everything is an expression. This heritage reveals itself through some con- structs that are not legal in other languages. In idiomatic Rust, the return keyword is omitted from functions as shown in the following snippet: fn is_even(n: i32) -> bool {   n % 2 == 0 } For example, Rust programmers assign variables from conditional expressions: fn main() {   let n = 123456;   let description = if is_even(n) {     \"even\"   } else {     \"odd\"   };   println!(\"{} is {}\", n, description);    } This can be extended to other blocks including match like this: fn main() {   let n = 654321;   let description = match is_even(n) {     true => \"even\",     false => \"odd\",   };   println!(\"{} is {}\", n, description);     } Perhaps most surprisingly, the break keyword also returns a value. This can be used to allow “infinite” loops to return values: fn main() {   let n = loop {       break 123;   };   println!(\"{}\", n);    } Prints \"123456  is even\" Prints \"654321  is odd\" Prints \"123\"'},\n",

Unlike C’s switch, how- ever, match guarantees that all possible options for a type are explicitly handled. Fail- ing to provide a branch for every possible value triggers a compiler error. Additionally, a match does not “fall through” to the next option by default. Instead, match returns immediately when a match is found.  Listing 2.8 demonstrates a larger example of match. The source code for this list- ing is in ch2/ch2-match-needles.rs. The code prints these two lines to the screen: 42: hit! 132: hit! You may wonder what parts of Rust are not expressions and, thus, do not return val- ues. Statements are not expressions.

Many control structures (like looping) are defined in terms of match under the hood. These really shine when combined with the Option type that’s discussed in depth in the next chapter.  Now that we have taken a good look at defining numbers and working with some of Rust’s flow control mechanisms, let’s move on to adding structure to programs with functions.  2.5 Defining functions Looking back to where the chapter begins, the snippet in listing 2.2 contained a small function, add(). add takes two i32 values and returns their sum. The following listing repeats the function. 10 fn add(i: i32, j: i32) -> i32 {     11   i + j 12 } For the moment, let’s concentrate on the syntax of each of the elements in listing 2.9. Figure 2.2 provides a visual picture of each of the pieces. Anyone who has pro- grammed in a strongly-typed programming language should be able to squint their way through the diagram.  Rust’s functions require that you specify your parameter’s types and the function’s return type. This is the foundational knowledge that we’ll need for the majority of our work with Rust. Let’s put it to use with our first non-trivial program.  Listing 2.8 Using match to match multiple values Listing 2.9 Defining a function (extract of listing 2.2) The variable needle  is now redundant. This match expression returns a value  that can be bound to a variable. Success! 42 | 132 matches  both 42 and 132. A wildcard pattern that  matches everything add() takes two integer parameters and  returns an integer. The two arguments  are bound to the local variables i and j.'},\n",

       "  'text': '53 Using references 2.6 Using references If you have only used a dynamic programming language so far in your career, the syn- tax and semantics of references can be frustrating. It can be difficult to form a mental picture of what is happening. That makes it difficult to understand which symbols to put where. Thankfully, the Rust compiler is a good coach.  A reference is a value that stands in place for another value. For example, imagine that variable a is a large array that is costly to duplicate. In some sense, a reference r is a cheap copy of a. But instead of creating a duplicate, the program stores a’s address in memory. When the data from a is required, r can be dereferenced to make a available. The following listing shows the code for this. fn main() {   let a = 42;   let r = &a;       let b = a + *r;           println!(\"a + a = {}\", b);    } References are created with the reference operator (&) and dereferencing occurs with the dereference operator (*). These operators act as unary operators, meaning that these only take one operand. One of the limitations of source code written in ASCII text is that multiplication and dereferencing use the same symbol. Let’s see these in use as part of a larger example.  Listing 2.11 searches for a number (the needle defined on line 2) within an array of numbers (the haystack defined on line 3). The code then prints 42 to the console when compiled. The code for this listing is in ch2/ch2-needle-in-haystack.rs.  1 fn main() {  2   let needle = 0o204;  3   let haystack = [1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 52, 203, 877, 4140, 21147];  4   5   for item in &haystack {     Listing 2.10 Creating a reference to a large array Listing 2.11 Searching for an integer in an array of integers fn add(i: i32, j: i32) -> i32 { Thin arrow to indicate return Identifier Return type Parameters Keyword Identifier Type Type Identifier Begin code block Figure 2.2 Rust’s function  definition syntax r is a reference to a.

So let’s do that now with listing 2.12. To begin 1 In a terminal window, execute the following commands to create a project that can render the Mandelbrot set: a cd $TMP (or cd %TMP% on MS Windows) to move to a directory that’s not critical. b cargo new mandelbrot --vcs none creates a new blank project. c cd mandelbrot moves into the new project root. d cargo add num to edit Cargo.toml, adding the num crate as a dependency (see the sidebar entitled “2.2” in section 2.3.4 for instructions to enable this cargo feature). 2 Replace src/main.rs with the code in listing 2.12, which you’ll also find in ch2/ch2-mandelbrot/src/main.rs. 3 Execute cargo run.

Let’s continue our exploration by learning how to define functions and types.  2.8 Advanced function definitions Rust’s functions can get somewhat scarier than the add(i: i32, j: i32) -> i32 from listing 2.2. To assist those who are reading more Rust source code than writing it, the following sections provide some extra content. 2.8.1 Explicit lifetime annotations As a bit of forewarning, allow me to introduce some more complicated notation. As you read through Rust code, you might encounter definitions that are hard to deci- pher because those look like hieroglyphs from an ancient civilizations. Listing 2.13 provides an extract from listing 2.14 that shows one such example.  1 fn add_with_lifetimes<\\'a, \\'b>(i: &\\'a i32, j: &\\'b i32) -> i32 {  2   *i + *j  3 } Like all unfamiliar syntax, it can be difficult to know what’s happening at first. This improves with time. Let’s start by explaining what is happening, and then go on to Listing 2.13 A function signature with explicit lifetime annotations'},\n",

       "  'text': '57 Advanced function definitions discuss why it is happening. The following bullet points break line 1 of the previous snippet into its parts: \\uf0a1 fn add_with_lifetimes(...) -> i32 should be familiar to you already. From this we can infer that add_with_lifetimes() is a function that returns an i32 value. \\uf0a1 <\\'a, \\'b> declares two lifetime variables, \\'a and \\'b, within the scope of add_with_lifetimes(). These are normally spoken as lifetime a and lifetime b. \\uf0a1 i: &\\'a i32 binds lifetime variable \\'a to the lifetime of i. The syntax reads as “parameter i is a reference to an i32 with lifetime a.” \\uf0a1 j: &\\'b i32 binds the lifetime variable \\'b to the lifetime of j. The syntax reads as “parameter j is a reference to an i32 with lifetime b.” The significance of binding a lifetime variable to a value probably isn’t obvious. Underpinning Rust’s safety checks is a lifetime system that verifies that all attempts to access data are valid. Lifetime annotations allow programmers to declare their intent. All values bound to a given lifetime must live as long as the last access to any value bound to that lifetime.  The lifetime system usually works unaided. Although every parameter has a life- time, these checks are typically invisible as the compiler can infer most lifetimes by itself.6 But the compiler needs assistance in difficult cases. Functions that accept multi- ple references as arguments or return a reference are often when the compiler will request assistance via an error message.  No lifetime annotations are required when calling a function. When used in a complete example as in the next listing, you can see lifetime annotations at the func- tion definition (line 1), but not when it’s used (line 8). The source code for the listing is in ch2-add-with-lifetimes.rs.  1 fn add_with_lifetimes<\\'a, \\'b>(i: &\\'a i32, j: &\\'b i32) -> i32 {  2   *i + *j       3 }  4   5 fn main() {  6   let a = 10;  7   let b = 20;  8   let res = add_with_lifetimes(&a, &b);      9  10   println!(\"{}\", res); 11 } On line 2, *i + *j adds together the referent values held by the i and j variables. It’s common to see lifetime parameters when using references. While Rust can infer lifetimes 6 Omitting lifetime annotations is formally referred to as lifetime elision. Listing 2.14 Type signature of a function with lifetime explicit annotations Adds the values referred to by  i and j rather than adding the  references directly &10 and &20 mean reference  10 and 20, respectively. No  lifetime notation is required  when calling a function.'},\n",

       "  'text': '58 CHAPTER 2 Language foundations in other cases, references require the programmer to specify the intent. Using two life- time parameters (a and b) indicates that the lifetimes of i and j are decoupled. NOTE Lifetime parameters are a way of providing control to the programmer while maintaining high-level code.  2.8.2 Generic functions Another special case of function syntax appears when programmers write Rust func- tions to handle many possible input types. So far, we have seen functions that accept 32-bit integers (i32). The following listing shows a function signature that can be called by many input types as long as these are all the same. fn add<T>(i: T, j: T) -> T {       i + j } Capital letters in place of a type indicate a generic type. Conventionally, the variables T, U, and V are used as placeholder values, but this is arbitrary. E is often used to denote an error type. We’ll look at error handling in detail in chapter 3.  Generics enable significant code reuse and can greatly increase the usability of a strongly-typed language. Unfortunately, listing 2.15 doesn’t compile as is. The Rust compiler complains that it cannot add two values of any type T together. The following shows the output produced when attempting to compile listing 2.15: error[E0369]: cannot add `T` to `T`  --> add.rs:2:5   | 2 |   i + j   |   - ^ - T   |   |   |   T   | help: consider restricting type parameter `T`   | 1 | fn add<T: std::ops::Add<Output = T>>(i: T, j: T) -> T {   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ error: aborting due to previous error For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0369`. This issue arises because T really means any type at all, even types where addition is not supported. Figure 2.3 provides a visual representation of the problem. Listing 2.15 attempts to refer to the outer ring, whereas addition is only supported by types within the inner ring. Listing 2.15 Type signature of a generic function The type variable T is introduced with angle brackets  (<T>).

       "  'text': '59 Advanced function definitions How do we specify that type T must implement addition? Answering this requires intro- ducing some new terminology.  All of Rust’s operators, including addition, are defined within traits. To require that type T must support addition, we include a trait bound alongside the type variable in the function’s definition. The following listing gives an example of this syntax. fn add<T: std::ops::Add<Output = T>>(i: T, j: T) -> T  {   i + j } The fragment <T: std::ops::Add<Output = T>> says that T must implement std::ops::Add. Using a single type variable T with the trait bound ensures that argu- ments i and j, as well as the result type, are the same type and that their type supports addition.  What is a trait? A trait is a language feature that is analogous to an interface, proto- col, or contract. If you have a background in object-oriented programming, consider a trait to be an abstract base class. If you have a background in functional program- ming, Rust’s traits are close to Haskell’s type classes. For now, it’s enough to say that traits enable types to advertise that they are using common behavior.  All of Rust’s operations are defined with traits. For example, the addition operator (+) is defined as the std::ops::Add trait. Traits are properly introduced in chapter 3 and are progressively explained in depth during the course of the book.  To reiterate: all of Rust’s operators are syntactic sugar for a trait’s methods. Rust supports operator overloading this way. During the compilation process, a + b is con- verted to a.add(b).  Listing 2.17 is a full example that demonstrates that generic functions can be called by multiple types. The listing prints these three lines to the console: 4.6 30 15s Listing 2.16 Type signature of a generic function with trait bounds All types Types that support addition by implementing std::ops::Add Figure 2.3 Only a subset of types have  implement operators.

Interpreting these can take some patience. Hopefully, you now have the tools to break the pieces apart in case you get stuck down the track. Here are a few principles that should assist you when reading Rust code: \\uf0a1Terms in lowercase (i, j) denote variables. \\uf0a1Single uppercase letters (T) denote generic type variables. \\uf0a1Terms beginning with uppercase (Add) are either traits or concrete types, such as String or Duration. \\uf0a1Labels (\\'a) denote lifetime parameters.  2.9 Creating grep-lite We’ve spent most of the chapter discussing numbers. It’s time for another practical example. We’ll use it to learn a little bit about how Rust handles text.  Listing 2.18 is our first iteration of grep-lite. The code for this program is in the ch2-str-simple-pattern.rs file. Its hard-coded parameters restrict flexibility somewhat, but these are useful illustrations of string literals. The code prints a line to the console: dark square is a picture feverishly turned--in search of what?  1 fn main() {  2   let search_term = \"picture\"; Listing 2.17 A generic function with a type variable and trait bounds Listing 2.18 Searching for a simple pattern within lines of a string Brings the Add trait from std::ops into local scope Brings the Duration  type from std::time  into local scope The arguments to add()  can accept any type  that implements  std::ops::Add.

Some features of list- ing 2.18 that are worth highlighting include the following. From here, we’ll expand the functionality of our proto-application: \\uf0a1Line 9 (quote.lines()) demonstrates iterating line-by-line in a platform- independent manner. \\uf0a1Line 10 (line.contains()) demonstrates searching for text using the method syntax. Navigating Rust’s rich collection of string types Strings are complicated for newcomers to Rust. Implementation details tend to bubble up from below and make comprehension difficult. How computers represent text is complicated, and Rust chooses to expose some of that complexity. This enables programmers to have full control but does place a burden on those learning the language. String and &str both represent text, yet are distinct types. Interacting with values from both types can be an annoying exercise at first as different methods are required to perform similar actions. Prepare yourself for irritating type errors as your intuition develops. Until that intuition develops, however, you will usually have fewer issues if you convert your data to the String type. A String is (probably) closest to what you know as a string type from other lan- guages. It supports familiar operations such as concatenation (joining two strings together), appending new text onto an existing string, and trimming whitespace. str is a high-performance, relatively feature-poor type. Once created, str values can- not expand or shrink. In this sense, these are similar to interacting with a raw memory array. Unlike a raw memory array, though, str values are guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 characters. str is usually seen in this form: &str. A &str (pronounced string slice) is a small type that contains a reference to str data and a length. Attempting to assign a variable to type str will fail. The Rust compiler wants to create fixed-sized variables within a function’s stack frame. As str values can be of arbitrary length, these can only be stored as local variables by reference. Multilined strings do not  require special syntax.  The \\\\ character on line 3  escapes the new line. lines() returns an iterator over quote  where each iteration is a line of text. Rust  uses each operating system’s conventions  on what constitutes a new line.'},\n",

This is equivalent to the -n option within the POSIX.1-2008 standard for the grep utility (http://mng.bz/ZPdZ).  Adding a few lines to our previous example, we now see the following line printed to the screen. Listing 2.19 shows the code that adds this functionality, which you’ll find in ch2/ch2-simple-with-linenums.rs: 2: dark square is a picture feverishly turned--in search of what? (continued) For those readers that have prior experience with systems programming, String uses dynamic memory allocation to store the text that it represents. Creating &str values avoids a memory allocation. String is an owned type. Ownership has a particular meaning within Rust. An owner is able to make any changes to the data and is responsible for deleting values that it owns when it leaves scope (this is fully explained in chapter 3). A &str is a bor- rowed type. In practical terms, this means that &str can be thought of as read-only data, whereas String is read-write. String literals (e.g., \"Rust in Action\") have the type &str. The full type signature including the lifetime parameter is &\\'static str. The \\'static lifetime is somewhat special. It too owes its name to implementation details. Executable programs can contain a section of memory that is hard-coded with values. That section is known as static memory because it is read-only during execution. Some other types may be encountered in your travels. Here’s a short list:a \\uf0a1 char—A single character encoded as 4 bytes. The internal representation of char is equivalent to UCS-4/UTF-32. This differs from &str and String, which encodes single characters as UTF-8. Conversion does impose a pen- alty, but it means that char values are of fixed-width and are, therefore, eas- ier for the compiler to reason about. Characters encoded as UTF-8 can span 1 to 4 bytes. \\uf0a1 [u8]—A slice of raw bytes, usually found when dealing with streams of binary data. \\uf0a1 Vec<u8>—A vector of raw bytes, usually created when consuming [u8] data. String is to Vec<u8> as str is to [u8]. \\uf0a1 std::ffi::OSString—A platform-native string. It’s behavior is close to String but without a guarantee that it’s encoded as UTF-8 and that it won’t contain the zero byte (0x00). \\uf0a1 std::path::Path—A string-like type that is dedicated to handling filesys- tem paths. Fully understanding the distinction between String and &str requires knowledge of arrays and vectors. Textual data is similar to these two types with added convenience methods applied over the top. a Unfortunately, this is not an exhaustive list. Specific use cases sometimes require special handling.'},\n",

In the GNU grep implementation, this is the -C NUM switch. To add support for that feature in grep-lite, we need to be able to create lists.  2.10 Making lists of things with arrays, slices, and vectors Lists of things are incredibly common. The two types that you will work with most often are arrays and vectors. Arrays are fixed-width and extremely lightweight.

The goal of this section is to support printing out n lines of context that sur- round a match. To get there, we need to segue somewhat and explain more fully arrays, slices, and vectors. The most useful type for this exercise is the vector. To learn about vectors, though, we need to start by learning about its two simpler cous- ins: arrays and slices. 2.10.1 Arrays An array, at least as far as Rust is concerned, is a tightly-packed collection of the same thing. It’s possible to replace items within an array, but its size cannot change. Because variable-length types like String add a degree of complication, we’ll revert back to dis- cussing numbers for a little while.  Creating arrays takes two forms. We can provide a comma-delimited list within square brackets (for example, [1, 2, 3]) or a repeat expression, where you furnish two values delimited by a semicolon (for example, [0; 100]). The value on the left (0) is repeated by the number of times on the right (100). Listing 2.21 shows each varia- tion on lines 2–5. The source code for this listing is in the ch2-3arrays.rs file. It prints these four lines to the console: [1, 2, 3]:     1 + 10 = 11    2 + 10 = 12    3 + 10 = 13    (\\uf053[1, 2, 3] = 6) [1, 2, 3]:     1 + 10 = 11    2 + 10 = 12    3 + 10 = 13    (\\uf053[1, 2, 3] = 6) [0, 0, 0]:     0 + 10 = 10    0 + 10 = 10    0 + 10 = 10    (\\uf053[0, 0, 0] = 0) [0, 0, 0]:     0 + 10 = 10    0 + 10 = 10    0 + 10 = 10    (\\uf053[0, 0, 0] = 0)  1 fn main() {  2   let one             = [1, 2, 3];  3   let two: [u8; 3]    = [1, 2, 3];  4   let blank1          = [0; 3];  5   let blank2: [u8; 3] = [0; 3];  6   7   let arrays = [one, two, blank1, blank2];  8   9   for a in &arrays { 10     print!(\"{:?}: \", a); 11     for n in a.iter() { 12       print!(\"\\\\t{} + 10 = {}\", n, n+10); 13     } 14  15     let mut sum = 0; 16     for i in 0..a.len() { 17       sum += a[i]; 18     } 19     println!(\"\\\\t(\\uf053{:?} = {})\", a, sum); 20   } 21 } Listing 2.21 Defining arrays and iterating over their elements'},\n",

       "  'text': '65 Making lists of things with arrays, slices, and vectors Arrays are a simple data structure from the machine’s point of view. These are a con- tiguous block of memory with elements of a uniform type. The simplicity is still some- what deceptive. Arrays can cause a few learning difficulties for newcomers: \\uf0a1The notation can be confusing.[T; n] describes an array’s type, where T is the ele- ments’ type and n is a non-negative integer. [f32; 12] denotes an array of 12 32-bit floating-point numbers. It’s easy to get confused with slices [T], which do not have a compile-time length. \\uf0a1 [u8; 3] is a different type than [u8; 4]. The size of the array matters to the type system. \\uf0a1In practice, most interaction with arrays occurs via another type called a slice ([T]). The slice is itself interacted with by reference (&[T]). And to add some linguistic confusion into the mix, both slices and references to slices are called slices. Rust maintains its focus on safety. Array indexing is bounds checked. Requesting an item that’s out of bounds crashes (panics in Rust terminology) the program rather than returning erroneous data.  2.10.2 Slices Slices are dynamically sized array-like objects. The term dynamically sized means that their size is not known at compile time. Yet, like arrays, these don’t expand or contract. The use of the word dynamic in dynamically sized is closer in meaning to dynamic typing rather than movement. The lack of compile-time knowledge explains the distinction in the type signature between an array ([T; n]) and a slice ([T]).  Slices are important because it’s easier to implement traits for slices than arrays. Traits are how Rust programmers add methods to objects. As [T; 1], [T; 2], …, [T; n] are all different types, implementing traits for arrays can become unwieldy. Creating a slice from an array is easy and cheap because it doesn’t need to be tied to any spe- cific size.  Another important use for slices is their ability to act as a view on arrays (and other slices). The term view here is taken from database technology and means that slices can gain fast, read-only access to data without needing to copy anything around.  The problem with slices is that Rust wants to know the size of every object in your program, and slices are defined as not having a compile-time size. References to the rescue. As mentioned in the discussion about the use of the term dynamically sized, slice size is fixed in memory. These are made up of two usize components (a pointer and a length). That’s why you typically see slices referred to in their referenced form, &[T] (like string slices that take the notation &str). NOTE Don’t worry too much about the distinctions between arrays and slices yet. In practice, it’s not material. Each term is an artifact of implementation details. Those implementation details are important when dealing with performance-critical code but not when learning the basics of the language.'},\n",

These incur a small runtime penalty compared to arrays because of the extra bookkeeping that must be done to enable their size to change over time. But vectors almost always make up for this with their added flexibility.  The task at hand is to expand the feature set of the grep-lite utility. Specifically, we want the ability to store n lines of context around a match. Naturally, there are many ways to implement such a feature.  To minimize code complexity, we’ll use a two-pass strategy. In the first pass, we’ll tag lines that match. During the second pass, we’ll collect lines that are within n lines of each of the tags.  The code in listing 2.22 (available at ch2/ch2-introducing-vec.rs) is the longest you’ve seen so far. Take your time to digest it.  The most confusing syntax in the listing is probably Vec<Vec<(usize, String)>>, which appears on line 15. Vec<Vec<(usize, String)>> is a vector of vectors (e.g., Vec<Vec<T>>), where T is a pair of values of type (usize, String). (usize, String) is a tuple that we’ll use to store line numbers along with the text that’s a near match. When the needle variable on line 3 is set to \"oo\", the following text is printed to the console: 1: Every face, every shop, 2: bedroom window, public-house, and 3: dark square is a picture 4: feverishly turned--in search of what? 3: dark square is a picture 4: feverishly turned--in search of what? 5: It is the same with books. 6: What do we seek 7: through millions of pages?  1 fn main() {  2   let ctx_lines = 2;  3   let needle = \"oo\";  4   let haystack = \"\\\\  5 Every face, every shop,  6 bedroom window, public-house, and  7 dark square is a picture  8 feverishly turned--in search of what?  9 It is the same with books. 10 What do we seek 11 through millions of pages?\"; 12  13   let mut tags: Vec<usize> = vec![];    14   let mut ctx: Vec<Vec<( 15                usize, String)>> = vec![];      16  17   for (i, line) in haystack.lines().enumerate() {    Listing 2.22 Enabling context lines to be printed out with a Vec<Vec<T>> tags holds line  numbers where  matches occur. ctx contains a vector  per match to hold the  context lines.

Providing an estimate minimizes the number of times memory will need to be allocated from the OS. NOTE When considering this approach in real text files, encodings can cause issues. String is guaranteed to be UTF-8. Naively reading in a text file to a String causes errors if invalid bytes are detected. A more robust approach is to read in data as [u8] (a slice of u8 values), then decode those bytes with help from your domain knowledge.  2.11 Including third-party code Incorporating third-party code is essential to productive Rust programming. Rust’s standard library tends to lack many things that other languages provide, like random number generators and regular expression support. That means it’s common to incorporate third-party crates into your project. To get your feet wet, let’s start with the regex crate. Vec::with_capacity(n)  reserves space for n  items. No explicit type  signature is required  as it can be inferred  via the definition of  ctx on line 15. When there are no  matches, exits early For each tag, at every  line, checks to see if  we are near a match.  When we are, adds  that line to the  relevant Vec<T>  within ctx. saturating_sub() is  subtraction that returns  0 on integer underflow  rather than crashing the  program (CPUs don’t like  attempting to send usize  below zero). Copies line into a new  String and stores that  locally for each match ref line informs the compiler  that we want to borrow this  value rather than move it.  These two terms are explained  fully in later chapters.'},\n",

Now that we’ve seen how to bring in third-party code, let’s take advantage of that to enable users of grep-lite to choose their own pattern.

Lastly, we take a deeper look at traits, Rust’s system for defining interfaces.  Throughout this chapter, you’ll work through how to represent files in code. Although conceptually simple—if you’re reading this book, it’s highly likely you’ve interacted with a file through code before—there are enough edge cases to make things interesting. Our strategy will be to create a mock version of everything using our own imaginary API. Then, toward the latter part of the chapter, you’ll learn how to interact with your actual operating system (OS) and its filesystem(s). 3.1 Using plain functions to experiment with an API To start, let’s see how far we can get by making use of the tools we already know. List- ing 3.1 lays out a few things that we would expect, such as opening and closing a file. We’ll use a rudimentary mock type to model one: a simple alias around String that holds a filename and little else.  To make things slightly more interesting than writing lots of boilerplate code, list- ing 3.1 sprinkles in a few new concepts. These show you how to tame the compiler while you’re experimenting with your design. It provides attributes (#![allow(unused _variables)]) to relax compiler warnings. The read function illustrates how to define a function that never returns. The code actually doesn’t do anything, however. That will come shortly. You’ll find the source for this listing in the file ch3/ch3-not- quite-file-1.rs.  1 #![allow(unused_variables)]      2   3 type File = String;               4   5 fn open(f: &mut File) -> bool {  6     true                           7   8 fn close(f: &mut File) -> bool {  9     true                        10 } 11  12 #[allow(dead_code)]     13 fn read(f: &mut File, 14         save_to: &mut Vec<u8>) -> ! {     15     unimplemented!()      16 } 17  18 fn main() { 19     let mut f1 = File::from(\"f1.txt\");    20     open(&mut f1); 21     //read(f1, vec![]);   22     close(&mut f1); 23 } Listing 3.1 Using type aliases to stub out a type Relaxes compiler warnings  while working through ideas Creates a type alias. The compiler  won’t distinguish between String &  File, but your source code will. Let’s assume for the moment that  these two functions always succeed.

       "  'text': '79 Using plain functions to experiment with an API There are lots of things that needs to be built on from listing 3.1. For example \\uf0a1We haven’t created a persistent object that would represent a file. There’s only so much that can be encoded in a string. \\uf0a1There’s no attempt to implement read(). If we did, how would we handle the failure case? \\uf0a1 open() and close() return bool. Perhaps there is a way to provide a more sophisticated result type that might be able to contain an error message if the OS reports one. \\uf0a1None of our functions are methods. From a stylistic point of view, it might be nice to call f.open() rather than open(f). Let’s begin at the top and work our way through this list. Brace yourself for a few sce- nic detours along the way as we encounter a few side roads that will be profitable to explore. Special return types in Rust If you are new to the language, some return types are difficult to interpret. These are also especially difficult to search for because they are made from symbols rather than words. Known as the unit type, () formally is a zero-length tuple. It is used to express that a function returns no value. Functions that appear to have no return type return (), and expressions that are terminated with a semicolon (;) return (). For example, the report() function in the following code block returns the unit type implicitly: use std::fmt::Debug; fn report<T: Debug>(item: T) {      println!(\"{:?}\", item);        } And this example returns the unit type explicitly: fn clear(text: &mut String) -> () {   *text = String::from(\"\");         } The unit type often occurs in error messages. It’s common to forget that the last expression of a function shouldn’t end with a semicolon. The exclamation symbol, !, is known as the “Never” type. Never indicates that a function never returns, especially when it is guaranteed to crash. For example, take this code: fn dead_end() -> ! {   panic!(\"you have reached a dead end\");    } item can be any type  that implements  std::fmt::Debug. {:?} directs the println! macro to  use std::fmt::Debug to convert  item to a printable string. Replaces the string at text  with an empty string The panic! macro causes the  program to crash. This means  the function is guaranteed  never to return.'},\n",

       "  'text': '80 CHAPTER 3 Compound data types 3.2 Modeling files with struct We need something to represent that thing we’re trying to model. struct allows you to create a composite type made up of other types. Depending on your programming heritage, you may be more familiar with terms such as object or record.  We’ll start with requiring that our files have a name and zero or more bytes of data. Listing 3.2 prints the following two lines to the console: File { name: \"f1.txt\", data: [] } f1.txt is 0 bytes long To represent data, listing 3.2 uses Vec<u8>, which is a growable list of u8 (single byte) values. The bulk of the main() function demonstrates usage (e.g., field access). The file ch3/ch3-mock-file.rs contains the code for this listing.  1 #[derive(Debug)]    2 struct File {  3   name: String,  4   data: Vec<u8>,      5 }  6   7 fn main() {  8   let f1 = File {  9     name: String::from(\"f1.txt\"),    10     data: Vec::new(),              11   }; 12  13   let f1_name = &f1.name;            14   let f1_length = &f1.data.len();    15  16   println!(\"{:?}\", f1); 17   println!(\"{} is {} bytes long\", f1_name, f1_length); 18 } (continued) The following example creates an infinite loop that prevents the function from returning: fn forever() -> ! {   loop {                //...   }; } As with the unit type, Never sometimes occurs within error messages. The Rust com- piler complains about mismatched types when you forget to add a break in your loop block if you’ve indicated that the function returns a non-Never type.  Listing 3.2 Defining an instance of struct to represent files Unless it contains a break, the  loop never finishes. This prevents  the function from returning. Allows println! to print File. The std::fmt::Debug  trait works in conjunction with {:?} within the  macro to enable File as a printable string. Using Vec<u8>, provides access to some useful  conveniences like dynamic sizing, which makes it  possible to simulate writing to a file String::from generates  owned strings from string  literals, which are slices. Here the vec! macro simulates an empty file. Accessing fields uses the . operator.  Accessing fields by reference prevents  their use after move issues.'},\n",

       "  'text': '81 Modeling files with struct Here is a detailed overview of listing 3.2: \\uf0a1Lines 1–5 define the File struct. Definitions include fields and their associated types. These also include each field’s lifetimes, which happened to be elided here. Explicit lifetimes are required when a field is a reference to another object. \\uf0a1Lines 8–11 create our first instance of File. We use a literal syntax here, but typi- cally structs in the wild are created via a convenience method. String::from() is one of those convenience methods. It takes a value of another type; in this case, a string slice (&str), which returns a String instance. Vec::new() is the more common case. \\uf0a1Lines 13–17 demonstrate accessing our new instance’s fields. We prepend an amper- sand to indicate that we want to access this data by reference. In Rust parlance, this means that the variables f1_name and f1_length are borrowing the data these refer to. You have probably noticed that our File struct doesn’t actually store anything to disk at all. That’s actually OK for now. If you’re interested, figure 3.1 shows its internals. In the figure, its two fields (name and data) are themselves both created by structs. If you’re unfamiliar with the term pointer (ptr), consider pointers to be the same thing as references for now. Pointers are variables that refer to some location in memory. The details are explained at length in chapter 6. We’ll leave interacting with the hard disk drive or other persistent storage until later in the chapter. For the meantime, let’s recreate listing 3.1 and add the File type as promised. The newtype pattern Sometimes the type keyword is all that you need. But what about when you need the compiler to treat your new “type” as a fully-fledged, distinct type rather than just an alias? Enter newtype. The newtype pattern consists of wrapping a core type within a single field struct (or perhaps a tuple). The following code shows how to distin- guish network hostnames from ordinary strings. You’ll find this code in ch3/ch3-new- type-pattern.rs: name String ptr size capacity data Vec<u8> ptr size capacity [u8; data.size] ... [u8; name.size] ...

Methods are functions that are coupled to some object. From a syntactic point of view, these are just functions that don’t need to specify one of their argu- ments. Rather than calling open() and passing a File object in as an argument (read(f, buffer)), methods allow the main object to be implicit in the function call (f.read(buffer)) using the dot operator.1  Rust is different than other languages that support methods: there is no class key- word. Types created with struct (and enum, which is described later) feel like classes at times, but as they don’t support inheritance, it’s probably a good thing that they’re named something different.  To define methods, Rust programmers use an impl block, which is physically dis- tinct in source code from the struct and enum blocks that you have already encoun- tered. Figure 3.2 shows the differences. 3.3.1 Simplifying object creation by implementing new() Creating objects with reasonable defaults is done through the new() method. Every struct can be instantiated through a literal syntax. This is handy for getting started, but leads to unnecessary verbosity in most code.  Using new() is a convention within the Rust community. Unlike other languages, new is not a keyword and isn’t given some sort of blessed status above other methods. Table 3.1 summarizes the conventions. 1 There are a number of theoretical differences between methods and functions, but a detailed discussion of those computer science topics is available in other books. Briefly, functions are regarded as pure, meaning their behavior is determined solely by their arguments. Methods are inherently impure, given that one of their argu- ments is effectively a side effect. These are muddy waters, though. Functions are perfectly capable of acting on side effects themselves. Moreover, methods are implemented with functions. And, to add an exception to an exception, objects sometimes implement static methods, which do not include implicit arguments.

If we did, how would we handle the failure case? \\uf0a1The methods open() and close() return bool. Is there a way to provide a more sophisticated result type to contain an error message if the OS reports one? The issue arises because dealing with hardware is unreliable. Even ignoring hardware faults, the disk might be full or the OS might intervene and tell you that you don’t have permission to delete a particular file. This section discusses different methods for signalling that an error has occurred, beginning with approaches common in other languages and finishing with idiomatic Rust. 3.4.1 Modifying a known global variable One of the simplest methods for signalling that an error has occurred is by checking the value of a global variable. Although notoriously error-prone, this is a common idiom in systems programming.  C programmers are used to checking the value of errno once system calls return. As an example, the close() system call closes a file descriptor (an integer representing a file with numbers assigned by the OS) and can modify errno. The section of the POSIX standard discussing the close() system call includes this snippet: “If close() is interrupted by a signal that is to be caught, it shall return -1 with errno set to EINTR and the state of fildes [file descriptor] is unspecified. If an I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system during close(), it may return -1 with errno set to EIO; if this error is returned, the state of fildes is unspecified.” —The Open Group Base Specifications (2018) Setting errno to either EIO or EINTR means to set it to some magical internal constant. The specific values are arbitrary and defined per OS. With the Rust syntax, checking global variables for error codes would look something like the following listing.     Here is the  change in the  calling code.'},\n",

The most significant is prob- ably the unsafe keyword, whose significance we’ll discuss later in the book. In the meantime, consider unsafe to be a warning sign rather than an indicator that you’re embarking on anything illegal. Unsafe means “the same level of safety offered by C at all times.” There are also some other small additions to the Rust language that you know already: \\uf0a1Mutable global variables are denoted with static mut. \\uf0a1By convention, global variables use ALL CAPS. \\uf0a1A const keyword is included for values that never change.

This style of programming would typ- ically be discouraged in Rust because it omits both type safety (errors are encoded as plain integers) and can reward sloppy programmers with unstable programs when they forget to check the errno value. However, it’s an important style to be aware of because \\uf0a1Systems programmers may need to interact with OS-defined global values. \\uf0a1Software that interacts with CPU registers and other low-level hardware needs to get used to inspecting flags to check that operations were completed successfully. The difference between const and let If variables defined with let are immutable, then why does Rust include a const key- word? The short answer is that data behind let can change. Rust allows types to have an apparently contradictory property of interior mutability. Some types such as std:sync::Arc and std:rc::Rc present an immutable façade, yet change their internal state over time. In the case of those two types, these incre- ment a reference count as references to those are made and decrement that count when those references expire. At the level of the compiler, let relates more to aliasing than immutability. Aliasing in compiler terminology refers to having multiple references to the same location in memory at the same time. Read-only references (borrows) to variables declared with let can alias the same data. Read-write references (mutable borrows) are guaran- teed to never alias data.\"},\n",

This type is known as Result. Result has two states, Ok and Err. This two-headed type is versatile and is put to work all through the standard library.  We’ll consider how a single type can act as two later on. For the moment, let’s investigate the mechanics of working with it. Listing 3.8 makes changes from previ- ous iterations: \\uf0a1Functions that interact with the file system, such as open() on line 39, return Result<File, String>. This effectively allows two types to be returned. When the function successfully executes, File is returned within a wrapper as Ok(File). When the function encounters an error, it returns a String within its own wrap- per as Err(String). Using a String as an error type provides an easy way to report error messages. \\uf0a1Calling functions that return Result<File, String> requires an extra method (unwrap()) to actually extract the value. The unwrap() call unwraps Ok(File) to produce File. It will crash the program if it encounters Err(String). More sophisticated error handling is explained in chapter 4. \\uf0a1 open() and close() now take full ownership of their File arguments. While we’ll defer a full explanation of the term ownership until chapter 4, it deserves a short explanation here. Rust’s ownership rules dictate when values are deleted. Passing the File argument to open() or close() without prepending an ampersand, e.g. &File or &mut File, passes ownership to the function that is being called. This would ordinarily mean that the argument is deleted when the function ends, but these two also return their arguments at the end. \\uf0a1The f4 variable now needs to reclaim ownership. Associated with the changes to the open() and close() functions is a change to the number of times that let f4 is used. f4 is now rebound after each call to open() and close(). With- out this, we would run into issues with using data that is no longer valid.

When called on an error type, the program crashes without a helpful error message. As the chapter progresses, we’ll encounter sophisticated mechanisms to han- dle errors. Using Result provides compiler-assisted code correctness: your code won’t compile unless you’ve taken the time to handle the edge cases. This program will fail on error, but at least we have made this explicit.  So, what is a Result? Result is an enum defined in Rust’s standard library. It has the same status as any other type but is tied together with the rest of the language through strong community conventions. You may be wondering, “Wait. What is an enum?” I’m glad you asked. That’s the topic of our next section.  In this code, read() never fails, but  we still wrap read_length in Ok  because we’re returning Result. Once in 10,000  executions,  returns an error Once in 100,000  executions,  returns an error Unwraps T from  Ok, leaving T'},\n",

       "  'text': '95 Defining and making use of an enum 3.5 Defining and making use of an enum An enum, or enumeration, is a type that can represent multiple known variants. Classi- cally, an enum represents several predefined known options like the suits of playing cards or planets in the solar system. The following listing shows one such enum. enum Suit {   Clubs,   Spades,   Diamonds,   Hearts, } If you haven’t programmed in a language that makes use of enums, understanding their value takes some effort. As you program with these for a while, though, you’re likely to experience a minor epiphany.  Consider creating some code that parses event logs. Each event has a name, per- haps UPDATE or DELETE. Rather than storing those values as strings in your application, which can lead to subtle bugs later on when string comparisons become unwieldy, enums allow you to give the compiler some knowledge of the event codes. Later, you’ll be given a warning such as “Hi there, I see that you have considered the UPDATE case, but it looks like you’ve forgotten the DELETE case. You should fix that.”  Listing 3.10 shows the beginnings of an application that parses text and emits structured data. When run, the program produces the following output. You’ll find the code for this listing in ch3/ch3-parse-log.rs: (Unknown, \"BEGIN Transaction XK342\") (Update, \"234:LS/32231 {\\\\\"price\\\\\": 31.00} -> {\\\\\"price\\\\\": 40.00}\") (Delete, \"342:LO/22111\")  1 #[derive(Debug)]          2 enum Event {  3     Update,      4     Delete,      5     Unknown,     6 }  7   8 type Message = String;    9  10 fn parse_log(line: &str) -> (Event, Message) {    11   let parts: Vec<_> = line                   12                       .splitn(2, \\' \\') 13                       .collect();         14   if parts.len() == 1 {                           15     return (Event::Unknown, String::from(line)) 16   } Listing 3.9 Defining an enum to represent the suits in a deck of cards Listing 3.10 Defining an enum and using it to parse an event log Prints this enum to the screen  via auto-generated code Creates three variants of  Event, including a value  for unrecognized events A convenient name for String  for use in this crate’s context A function for  parsing a line and  converting it into  semi-structured  data Vec<_> asks Rust to infer the elements’ type. collect() consumes an iterator from  line.splitn() and returns Vec<T>.

It’s possible to include data within an enum’s variants, granting them a struct-like per- sona. For example enum Suit {   Clubs,   Spades,   Diamonds,   Hearts,      } enum Card {   King(Suit),            Queen(Suit),           Jack(Suit),            Ace(Suit),             Pip(Suit, usize),   } 3.5.1 Using an enum to manage internal state Now that you’ve seen how to define and use an enum, how is this useful when applied to modelling files? We can expand our File type and allow it to change as it is opened and closed. Listing 3.11 (ch3/ch3-file-states.rs) produces code that prints a short alert to the console: Assigns each part of parts to a  variable to ease future use When we match a known event,  returns structured data If we don’t recognize  the event type, returns  the whole line The last element of enums  also ends with a comma to  ease refactoring.

Con- sider them for your code when you discover yourself introducing “stringly-typed” data, such as message codes.  3.6 Defining common behavior with traits A robust definition of the term file needs to be agnostic to storage medium. Files sup- port two main operations: reading and writing streams of bytes. Focusing on those two capabilities allows us to ignore where the reads and writes are actually taking place. These actions can be from a hard disk drive, an in-memory cache, over a network, or via something more exotic.  Irrespective of whether a file is a network connection, a spinning metal platter, or a superposition of an electron, it’s possible to define rules that say, “To call yourself a file, you must implement this.”  You have already seen traits in action several times. Traits have close relatives in other languages. These are often named interfaces, protocols, type classes, abstract base classes, or, perhaps, contracts.  Every time you’ve used #[derive(Debug)] in a type definition, you’ve imple- mented the Debug trait for that type. Traits permeate the Rust language. Let’s see how to create one. 3.6.1 Creating a Read trait Traits enable the compiler (and other humans) to know that multiple types are attempting to perform the same task. Types that use #[derive(Debug)] all print to the console via the println! macro and its relatives. Allowing multiple types to imple- ment a Read trait enables code reuse and allows the Rust compiler to perform its zero cost abstraction wizardry.  For the sake of brevity, listing 3.12 (ch3/ch3-skeleton-read-trait.rs) is a bare-bones version of the code that we’ve already seen. It shows the distinction between the trait keyword, which is used for definitions, and the impl keyword, which attaches a trait to'},\n",

When built with rustc and executed, listing 3.12 prints the following line to the console: 0 byte(s) read from File  1 #![allow(unused_variables)]       2   3 #[derive(Debug)]  4 struct File;        5   6 trait Read {                7     fn read(  8       self: &Self,  9       save_to: &mut Vec<u8>, 10     ) -> Result<usize, String>;    11 } 12  13 impl Read for File { 14     fn read(self: &File, save_to: &mut Vec<u8>) -> Result<usize, String> { 15         Ok(0)        16     } 17 } 18  19 fn main() { 20     let f = File{}; 21     let mut buffer = vec!(); 22     let n_bytes = f.read(&mut buffer).unwrap(); 23     println!(\"{} byte(s) read from {:?}\", n_bytes, f); 24 } Defining a trait and implementing it on the same page can feel quite drawn out in small examples such as this. File is spread across three code blocks within listing 3.12. The flip side of this is that many common traits become second nature as your experi- ence grows. Once you’ve learned what the PartialEq trait does for one type, you’ll understand it for every other type.  What does PartialEq do for types? It enables comparisons with the == operator. “Partial” allows for cases where two values that match exactly should not be treated as equal, such as the floating point’s NAN value or SQL’s NULL. NOTE If you’ve spent some time looking through the Rust community’s forums and documentation, you might have noticed that they’ve formed their own idi- oms of English grammar. When you see a sentence with the following structure, “…T is Debug…”, what they’re saying is that T implements the Debug trait.  3.6.2 Implementing std::fmt::Display for your own types The println! macro and a number of others live within a family of macros that all use the same underlying machinery. The macros println!, print!, write!, writeln!, and format! all rely on the Display and Debug traits, and these rely on trait implementa- tions provided by programmers to convert from {} to what is printed to the console.

If you recall, that listing illustrated the use of the Debug trait as repeated in the following listing. #[derive(Debug,PartialEq)] enum FileState {   Open,   Closed, } #[derive(Debug)] struct File {   name: String,   data: Vec<u8>,   state: FileState, } //...          fn main() {   let f5 = File::new(\"f5.txt\");   //...          println!(\"{:?}\", f5);       // ...       } It’s possible to rely on the Debug trait auto-implementations as a crutch, but what should you do if you want to provide custom text? Display requires that types imple- ment a fmt method, which returns fmt::Result. The following listing shows this implementation. impl Display for FileState {   fn fmt(&self, f:          &mut fmt::Formatter,   ) -> fmt::Result {                  match *self {       FileState::Open => write!(f, \"OPEN\"),       FileState::Closed => write!(f, \"CLOSED\"),     }   } } impl Display for File {    fn fmt(&self, f:           &mut fmt::Formatter,    ) -> fmt::Result {                   write!(f, \"<{} ({})>\", Listing 3.13 Snippets from listing 3.11 Listing 3.14 Using std::fmt::Display for File and its associated FileState Lines skipped from the original Debug relies on the  colon and question  mark syntax.

These underlie Rust’s generics system and the language’s robust type checking. With a little bit of abuse, these also support a form of inheritance that’s common in most object oriented lan- guages. For now, though, the thing to remember is that traits represent common behavior that types opt into via the syntax impl Trait for Type.  3.7 Exposing your types to the world Your crates will interact with others that you build over time. You might want to make that process easier for your future self by hiding internal details and documenting what’s public. This section describes some of the tooling available within the language and within cargo to make that process easier. 3.7.1 Protecting private data Rust defaults to keeping things private. If you were to create a library with only the code that you have seen so far, importing your crate would provide no extra benefit. To remedy this, use the pub keyword to make things public.  Listing 3.16 provides a few examples of prefixing types and methods with pub. As you’ll note, its output is not very exciting: File { name: \"f7.txt\", data: [], state: Closed }  1 #[derive(Debug,PartialEq)]  2 pub enum FileState {       3   Open,  4   Closed,  5 }  6   7 #[derive(Debug)]  8 pub struct File {  9   pub name: String, 10   data: Vec<u8>,              11   pub state: FileState, 12 } 13  14 impl File { 15   pub fn new(name: &str) -> File {     16     File { 17         name: String::from(name), Listing 3.16 Using pub to mark the name and state fields of File public The Debug implementation prints a familiar  message in common with all other  implementors of Debug: File { … }. Our Display implementation  follows its own rules, displaying  itself as <f6.txt (CLOSED)>. An enum’s variants are  assumed to be public if the  overall type is made public.

Instead of produc- ing executable code, it produces HTML versions of your inline documentation.  Here is how to use it. Assuming that you have the code from listing 3.17 saved as ch3-file-doced.rs, follow these steps: 1 Open a terminal. 2 Move to the location of your source file. 3 Execute rustdoc ch3-file-doced.rs. rustdoc creates a directory (doc/) for you. The documentation’s entry point is actu- ally within a subdirectory: doc/ch3_file_doced/index.html.  When your programs start to get larger and span multiple files, invoking rustdoc manually can become a bit of a pain. Thankfully, cargo can do the grunt work on your behalf. That’s discussed in the next section.  3.8.2 Using cargo to render docs for a crate and its dependencies Your documentation can be rendered as rich HTML output with cargo. cargo works with crates rather than the individual files as we’ve worked with so far. To get around this, we’ll move our project into a crate documentation: To manually create the crate, following these instructions: 1 Open a terminal. 2 Move to a working directory, such as /tmp/, or for Windows, type cd %TEMP%. 3 Run cargo new filebasics. You should end up with a project directory tree that looks like this: filebasics ├──Cargo.toml └──src    └──main.rs     4 Now save the source code from listing 3.17 to filebasics/src/main.rs, overwrit- ing the “Hello World!” boilerplate code that is already in the file.

The details of borrow checking are thoroughly explored within the chapter. However, a few points might be useful for readers want- ing to quickly get the gist. Borrow checking relies on three interrelated concepts— lifetimes, ownership, and borrowing: \\uf0a1Ownership is a stretched metaphor. There is no relationship to property rights. Within Rust, ownership relates to cleaning values when these are no longer needed. For example, when a function returns, the memory holding its local variables needs to be freed. Owners cannot prevent other parts of the program from accessing their values or report data theft to some overarching Rust authority. \\uf0a1A value’s lifetime is the period when accessing that value is valid behavior. A function’s local variables live until the function returns, while global variables might live for the life of the program. \\uf0a1To borrow a value means to access it. This terminology is somewhat confusing as there is no obligation to return the value to its owner. Its meaning is used to emphasize that while values can have a single owner, it’s possible for many parts of the program to share access to those values. 4.1 Implementing a mock CubeSat ground station Our strategy for this chapter is to use an example that compiles. Then we’ll make a minor change that triggers an error that appears to emerge without any adjustment to the program’s flow. Working through the fixes to those issues should make the con- cepts more complete.  The learning example for the chapter is a CubeSat constellation. If you’ve never encountered that phrase before, here are some definitions: \\uf0a1CubeSat—A miniature artificial satellite, as compared to a conventional satellite, that has increasingly expanded the accessibility of space research. \\uf0a1Ground station—An intermediary between the operators and the satellites them- selves. It listens on a radio, checking the status of every satellite in the constella- tion and transmitting messages to and fro. When introduced in our code, it acts as the gateway between the user and the satellites. \\uf0a1Constellation—The collective noun for satellites in orbit.

       "  'text': '109 Implementing a mock CubeSat ground station In figure 4.1, we have three CubeSats. To model this, we’ll create a variable for each. This model can happily implement integers for the moment. We don’t need to model the ground station explicitly because we’re not yet sending messages around the con- stellations. We’ll omit that model for now. These are the variables: let sat_a = 0; let sat_b = 1; let sat_c = 2; To check on the status of each of our satellites, we’ll use a stub function and an enum to represent potential status messages: #[derive(Debug)] enum StatusMessage {   Ok,                                       } fn check_status(sat_id: u64) -> StatusMessage {   StatusMessage::Ok                         } The check_status() function would be extremely complicated in a production sys- tem. For our purposes, though, returning the same value every time is perfectly suffi- cient. Pulling these two snippets into a whole program that “checks” our satellites twice, we end up with something like the following listing. You’ll find this code in the file ch4/ch4-check-sats-1.rs.  1 #![allow(unused_variables)]  2   3 #[derive(Debug)]  4 enum StatusMessage {  5   Ok,  6 }  7   8 fn check_status(sat_id: u64) -> StatusMessage {  9   StatusMessage::Ok 10 } 11  12 fn main () { 13   let sat_a = 0;     14   let sat_b = 1;     15   let sat_c = 2;     16  17   let a_status = check_status(sat_a); 18   let b_status = check_status(sat_b); 19   let c_status = check_status(sat_c); 20   println!(\"a: {:?}, b: {:?}, c: {:?}\", a_status, b_status, c_status); 21  22   // \"waiting\" ... 23   let a_status = check_status(sat_a); Listing 4.1 Checking the status of our integer-based CubeSats For now, all of our CubeSats function perfectly all the time.

We encounter the following output from our program: a: Ok, b: Ok, c: Ok a: Ok, b: Ok, c: Ok 4.1.1 Encountering our first lifetime issue Let’s move closer to idiomatic Rust by introducing type safety. Instead of integers, let’s create a type to model our satellites.

It tells us exactly where the problem is and provides us with a recommendation on how to fix it. To less experienced eyes, it’s significantly less useful. We are using a “moved” value and are fully advised to imple- ment the Copy trait on CubeSat. Huh? It turns out that although it is written in English, the term move means something very specific within Rust. Nothing physically moves.  Movement within Rust code refers to movement of ownership, rather than the movement of data. Ownership is a term used within the Rust community to refer to the compile-time process that checks that every use of a value is valid and that every value is destroyed cleanly.  Every value in Rust is owned. In both listings 4.1 and 4.3, sat_a, sat_b, and sat_c own the data that these refer to. When calls to check_status() are made, ownership of the data moves from the variables in the scope of main() to the variable sat_id within the check_status() function. The significant difference is that listing 4.3 places that integer within a CubeSat struct.1 This type change alters the semantics of how the program behaves. 1 Remember the phrase zero-cost abstractions? One of the ways this manifests is by not adding extra data around values within structs. Lines removed  for brevity'},\n",

It is centered on sat_a and attempts to show how ownership moves from main() into check_status(). fn main() {   let sat_a = CubeSat { id: 0 };      // ...        let a_status = check_status(sat_a);      // ...        // \"waiting\" ...   let a_status = check_status(sat_a);      // ...      } Figure 4.2 provides a visual walk-through of the interrelated processes of control flow, ownership, and lifetimes. During the call to check_status(sat_a), ownership moves to the check_status() function. When check_status() returns a StatusMessage, it drops the sat_a value. The lifetime of sat_a ends here. Yet, sat_a remains in the local scope of main() after the first call to check_status(). Attempting to access that variable will incur the wrath of the borrow checker.  The distinction between a value’s lifetime and its scope—which is what many pro- grammers are trained to rely on—can make things difficult to disentangle. Avoiding and overcoming this type of issue makes up the bulk of this chapter. Figure 4.2 helps to shed some light on this.  4.1.2 Special behavior of primitive types Before carrying on, it might be wise to explain why listing 4.1 compiled at all. Indeed, the only change that we made in listing 4.3 was to wrap our satellite variables in a cus- tom type. As it happens, primitive types in Rust have special behavior. These imple- ment the Copy trait. Listing 4.4 Extract of listing 4.3, focusing on main() Rebinding is legal when values are not borrowed If you have experience with programming languages such as JavaScript (from 2015 onward), you may have been surprised to see that the variables for each of the CubeSats were redefined in listing 4.3. In that listing on line 20, a_status is assigned to the result of the first call to check_status(sat_a). On line 26, it is reassigned to the result of the second call. The original value is overwritten. This is legal Rust code, but one must be aware of ownership issues and lifetime here too. It’s possible in this context because there are no live borrows to contend with. Attempting to overwrite a value that’s still available from elsewhere in the program causes the compiler to refuse to compile your program. Ownership originates  here at the creation of  the CubeSat object. Lines skipped for brevity Ownership of the object  moves to check_status() but  is not returned to main(). At line 27, sat_a is no longer  the owner of the object,  making access invalid.'},\n",

This provides some day-to-day convenience at the expense of adding a trap for newcomers. As you grow out from toy programs using integers, your code suddenly breaks.  Formally, primitive types are said to possess copy semantics, whereas all other types have move semantics. Unfortunately, for learners of Rust, that special case looks like the default case because beginners typically encounter primitive types first. Listings 4.5 and 4.6 illustrate the difference between these two concepts. The first compiles and runs; the other does not. The only difference is that these listings use different types.

An owner cleans up when its values’ lifetimes end.  When values go out of scope or their lifetimes end for some other reason, their destructors are called. A destructor is a function that removes traces of the value from the program by deleting references and freeing memory. You won’t find a call to any destructors in most Rust code. The compiler injects that code itself as part of the pro- cess of tracking every value’s lifetime.  To provide a custom destructor for a type, we implement Drop. This typically is needed in cases where we have used unsafe blocks to allocate memory. Drop has one method, drop(&mut self), that you can use to conduct any necessary wind-up activities.  An implication of this system is that values cannot outlive their owner. This kind of situation can make data structures built with references, such as trees and graphs, feel slightly bureaucratic. If the root node of a tree is the owner of the whole tree, it can’t be removed without taking ownership into account.  Finally, unlike the Lockean notion of personal property, ownership does not imply control or sovereignty. In fact, the “owners” of values do not have special access to their owned data. Nor do these have the ability to restrict others from trespassing. Owners don’t get a say on other sections of code borrowing their values.  4.4 How ownership moves There are two ways to shift ownership from one variable to another within a Rust pro- gram. The first is by assignment.2 The second is by passing data through a function barrier, either as an argument or a return value. Revisiting our original code from list- ing 4.3, we can see that sat_a starts its life with ownership over a CubeSat object: fn main() {   let sat_a = CubeSat { id: 0 };   // ... The CubeSat object is then passed into check_status() as an argument. This moves ownership to the local variable sat_id: fn main() {   let sat_a = CubeSat { id: 0 };   // ...   let a_status = check_status(sat_a);   // ... Another possibility is that sat_a relinquishes its ownership to another variable within main(). That would look something like this: 2 Within the Rust community, the term variable binding  is preferred because it is more technically correct.'},\n",

Lastly, if there is a change in the check_status() function signature, it too could pass ownership of the CubeSat to a variable within the calling scope. Here is our original function: fn check_status(sat_id: CubeSat) -> StatusMessage {   StatusMessage::Ok } And here is an adjusted function that achieves its message notification through a side effect: fn check_status(sat_id: CubeSat) -> CubeSat {   println!(\"{:?}: {:?}\", sat_id,                                    StatusMessage::Ok);   sat_id       } With the adjusted check_status() function used in conjunction with a new main(), it’s possible to send ownership of the CubeSat objects back to their original variables.

It provides a route to memory safety without needing a garbage collector. There is a “but,” however.  The ownership system can trip you up if you don’t understand what’s happening. This is particularly the case when you bring the programming style from your past experience to a new paradigm. Four general strategies can help with ownership issues: \\uf0a1Use references where full ownership is not required. \\uf0a1Duplicate the value. \\uf0a1Refactor code to reduce the number of long-lived objects. \\uf0a1Wrap your data in a type designed to assist with movement issues. To examine each of these strategies, let’s extend the capabilities of our satellite net- work. Let’s give the ground station and our satellites the ability to send and receive messages. Figure 4.5 shows what we want to achieve: create a message at Step 1, then transfer it at Step 2. After Step 2, no ownership issues should arise. Ignoring the details of implementing the methods, we want to avoid code that looks like the following. Moving ownership of sat_a to a local variable in base.send() ends up hurting us. That value will no longer be accessible for the rest of main(): base.send(sat_a, \"hello!\");     sat_a.recv(); To get to a “toy” implementation, we need a few more types to help us out somewhat. In listing 4.8, we add a new field, mailbox, to CubeSat. CubeSat.mailbox is a Mailbox struct that contains a vector of Messages within its messages field. We alias String to Message, giving us the functionality of the String type without needing to implement it ourselves.  1 #[derive(Debug)]  2 struct CubeSat {  3   id: u64, Listing 4.8 Adding a Mailbox type to our system Step 1: base.send() Step 2: sat_a.recv() Figure 4.5 Goal: Enable messages  to be sent while avoiding ownership  issues Moves ownership of sat_a to a  local variable in base.send()'},\n",

To create one now, we also need to create its associated Mailbox and the mailbox’s associated Vec<Message>. The following listing shows this addition. CubeSat { id: 100, mailbox: Mailbox { messages: vec![] } } Another type to add is one that represents the ground station itself. We will use a bare struct for the moment, as shown in the following listing. That allows us to add meth- ods to it and gives us the option of adding a mailbox as a field later on as well. struct GroundStation; Creating an instance of GroundStation should be trivial for you now. The following listing shows this implementation. GroundStation {}; Now that we have our new types in place, let’s put these to work. You’ll see how in the next section. 4.5.1 Use references where full ownership is not required The most common change you will make to your code is to reduce the level of access you require. Instead of requesting ownership, you can use a “borrow” in your function definitions. For read-only access, use & T. For read-write access, use &mut T.  Ownership might be needed in advanced cases, such as when functions want to adjust the lifetime of their arguments. Table 4.1 compares the two different approaches.

       "  'text': '120 CHAPTER 4 Lifetimes, ownership, and borrowing Sending messages will eventually be wrapped up in a method, but with essence func- tions, implementing that modifies the internal mailbox of the CubeSat. For simplic- ity’s sake, we’ll return () and hope for the best in case of transmission difficulties caused by solar winds.  The following snippet shows the flow that we want to end up with. The ground sta- tion can send a message to sat_a with its send() method, and sat_a then receives the message with its recv() method: base.send(sat_a, \"hello!\".to_string()); let msg = sat_a.recv(); println!(\"sat_a received: {:?}\", msg); // -> Option(\"hello!\") The next listing shows the implementations of these methods. To achieve that flow, add the implementations to GroundStation and CubeSat types.  1 impl GroundStation {  2     fn send(  3       &self,               4       to: &mut CubeSat,    5       msg: Message,        6     ) {  7         to.mailbox.messages.push(msg);     8     }  9 } 10  11 impl CubeSat { 12     fn recv(&mut self) -> Option<Message> { 13         self.mailbox.messages.pop() 14     } 15 } Notice that both GroundStation.send() and CubeSat.recv() require mutable access to a CubeSat instance because both methods modify the underlying CubeSat.messages vector. We move ownership of the message that we’re sending into the messages.push(). This provides us with some quality assurance later, notifying us if we access a message after it’s already sent. Figure 4.6 illustrates how we can avoid ownership issues. Table 4.1 Comparing ownership and mutable references Using ownership Using a mutable reference fn send(to: CubeSat, msg: Message) {   to.mailbox.messages.push(msg); } fn send(to: &mut CubeSat, msg: Message) {   to.mailbox.messages.push(msg); } Ownership of the to variable moves into  send(). When send() returns, to is deleted. Adding the &mut prefix to the CubeSat type allows  the outer scope to retain ownership of data referred to  by the to variable. Listing 4.12 Adding the GroundStation.send() and CubeSat.recv() methods &self indicates that GroundStation.send() only requires  a read-only reference to self. The recipient takes a  mutable borrow (&mut) of the CubeSat instance, and  msg takes full ownership of its Message instance. Ownership of the Message  instance transfers from  msg to messages.push()  as a local variable.'},\n",

Rather than using an approach involving long-standing objects, consider making objects that are more discrete and ephemeral. Ownership issues can sometimes be resolved by considering the design of the overall program.  In our CubeSat case, we don’t need to handle much complexity at all. Each of our four variables—base, sat_a, sat_b, and sat_c—live for the duration of main(). In a production system, there can be hundreds of different components and many thousands of interactions to manage. To increase the manageability of this kind of scenario, let’s break things apart. Figure 4.7 presents the game plan for this section.  To implement this kind of strategy, we will create a function that returns CubeSat identifiers. That function is assumed to be a black box that’s responsible for commu- nicating with some store of identifiers, such as a database. When we need to communi- cate with a satellite, we’ll create a new object, as the following code snippet shows. In this way, there is no requirement for us to maintain live objects for the whole of the program’s duration. It also has the dual benefit that we can afford to transfer owner- ship of our short-lived variables to other functions: fn fetch_sat_ids() -> Vec<u64> {      vec![1,2,3] } We’ll also create a method for GroundStation. This method allows us to create a CubeSat instance on demand once: impl GroundStation {   fn connect(&self, sat_id: u64) -> CubeSat {     CubeSat { id: sat_id, mailbox: Mailbox { messages: vec![] } }   } } Now we are a bit closer to our intended outcome. Our main function looks like the following code snippet. In effect, we’ve implemented the first half of figure 4.7.   Returns a vector  of CubeSat IDs'},\n",

Our CubeSat instances die at the end of the for loop’s scope, along with any messages that base sends to them. To carry on with our design decision of short-lived variables, the messages need to live somewhere outside of the CubeSat instances. In a real system, these would live on the RAM of a device in zero gravity. In our not-really-a-simulator, let’s put these in a buffer object that lives for the duration of our program.  Our message store will be a Vec<Message> (our Mailbox type defined in one of the first code examples of this chapter). We’ll change the Message struct to add a sender and recipient field, as the following code shows. That way our now-proxy CubeSat instances can match their IDs to receive messages: #[derive(Debug)] struct Mailbox {   messages: Vec<Message>, } #[derive(Debug)] struct Message {     to: u64,     content: String, } We also need to reimplement sending and receiving messages. Up until now, CubeSat objects have had access to their own mailbox object. The central GroundStation also had the ability to sneak into those mailboxes to send messages. That needs to change now because only one mutable borrow can exist per object.  In the modifications in listing 4.14, the Mailbox instance is given the ability to modify its own message vector. When any of the satellites transmit messages, these take a mutable borrow to the mailbox. These then defer the delivery to the mailbox object. According to this API, although our satellites are able to call Mailbox methods, these are not allowed to touch any internal Mailbox data themselves.  1 impl GroundStation {  2     fn send(  3       &self, Listing 4.14 Modifications to Mailbox'},\n",

As we saw in the previous section, it can be quite a lot of work to wriggle out of an early design decision.  One alternative to refactoring is to simply copy values. Doing this often is typically frowned upon, however, but it can be useful in a pinch. Primitive types like integers are a good example of that. Primitive types are cheap for a CPU to duplicate—so cheap, in fact, that Rust always copies these if it would otherwise worry about ownership being moved.  Types can opt into two modes of duplication: cloning and copying. Each mode is provided by a trait. Cloning is defined by std::clone::Clone, and the copying mode is defined by std::marker::Copy. Copy acts implicitly. Whenever ownership would otherwise be moved to an inner scope, the value is duplicated instead. (The bits of object a are replicated to create object b.) Clone acts explicitly. Types that implement Clone have a .clone() method that is permitted to do whatever it needs to do to create a new value. Table 4.2 outlines the major differences between the two modes.'},\n",

       "  'text': '129 Resolving ownership issues So why do Rust programmers not always use Copy? There are three main reasons: \\uf0a1The Copy trait implies that there will only be negligible performance impact. This is true for numbers but not true for types that are arbitrarily large, such as String. \\uf0a1Because Copy creates exact copies, it cannot treat references correctly. Naïvely copying a reference to T would (attempt to) create a second owner of T. That would cause problems later on because there would be multiple attempts to delete T as each reference is deleted. \\uf0a1Some types overload the Clone trait. This is done to provide something similar to, yet different from, creating duplicates. For example, std::rc::Rc<T> uses Clone to create additional references when .clone() is called. NOTE Throughout your time with Rust, you will normally see the std::clone ::Clone and std::marker::Copy traits referred to simply as Clone and Copy. These are included in every crate’s scope via the standard prelude. IMPLEMENTING COPY Let’s go back to our original example (listing 4.3), which caused the original movement issue. Here it is replicated for convenience, with sat_b and sat_c removed for brevity: #[derive(Debug)] struct CubeSat {   id: u64, } #[derive(Debug)] enum StatusMessage {   Ok, } fn check_status(sat_id: CubeSat) -> StatusMessage {   StatusMessage::Ok } fn main() {   let sat_a = CubeSat { id: 0 };   let a_status = check_status(sat_a);   println!(\"a: {:?}\", a_status); Table 4.2 Distinguishing cloning from copying Cloning (std::clone::Clone) Copying (std::marker::Copy) \\uf0a1May be slow and expensive. \\uf0a1Never implicit. A call to the .clone() method is  always required. \\uf0a1May differ from original. Crate authors define what  cloning means for their types. \\uf0a1Always fast and cheap. \\uf0a1Always implicit. \\uf0a1Always identical.

That’s good because it means implementing it ourselves is fairly straightforward, as the following listing shows. #[derive(Copy,Clone,Debug)]   struct CubeSat {   id: u64, } #[derive(Copy,Clone,Debug)]   enum StatusMessage {   Ok, } The following listing shows how it’s possible to implement Copy manually.

We’ve discussed that Copy is implicit. When ownership would otherwise move, such as during assignment and passing through function barriers, data is copied instead.  Clone requires an explicit call to .clone(). That’s a useful marker in non-trivial cases, such as in listing 4.18, because it warns the programmer that the process may be expensive. You’ll find the source for this listing in ch4/ch4-check-sats-clone-and-copy- traits.rs.

A final strategy that is quite common is to use wrapper types, which allow more flexibility than what is available by default. These, however, incur costs at runtime to ensure that Rust’s safety guarantees are maintained. Another way to phrase this is that Rust allows programmers to opt in to garbage collection.3  To explain the wrapper type strategy, let’s introduce a wrapper type: std:rc::Rc. std:rc::Rc takes a type parameter T and is typically referred to as Rc<T>. Rc<T> reads as “R. C. of T” and stands for “a reference-counted value of type T.” Rc<T> provides shared ownership of T. Shared ownership prevents T from being removed from memory until every owner is removed.  As indicated by the name, reference counting is used to track valid references. As each reference is created, an internal counter increases by one. When a reference is dropped, the count decreases by one. When the count hits zero, T is also dropped.  Wrapping T involves a calling Rc::new(). The following listing, at ch4/ch4-rc- groundstation.rs, shows this approach.     Listing 4.18 Using Clone and Copy 3 Garbage collection (often abbreviated as GC) is a strategy for memory management used by many program- ming languages, including Python and JavaScript, and all languages built on the JVM (Java, Scala, Kotlin) or the CLR (C#, F#). Copy implies  Clone, so we  can use either  trait later. Cloning each object is as  easy as calling .clone(). Copy works  as expected.'},\n",

Every call to base.clone() increments an internal counter. Every Drop decrements that counter. When the internal counter reaches zero, the original instance is freed.  Rc<T> does not allow mutation. To permit that, we need to wrap our wrapper. Rc<RefCell<T>> is a type that can be used to perform interior mutability, first intro- duced at the end of of chapter 3 in section 3.4.1. An object that has interior mutability presents an immutable façade while internal values are being modified.  In the following example, we can modify the variable base despite being marked as an immutable variable. It’s possible to visualize this by looking at the changes to the internal base.radio_freq: base: RefCell { value: GroundStation { radio_freq: 87.65 } } base_2: GroundStation { radio_freq: 75.31 } base: RefCell { value: GroundStation { radio_freq: 75.31 } } base: RefCell { value: \"<borrowed>\" }                base_3: GroundStation { radio_freq: 118.52000000000001 } The following listing, found at ch4/ch4-rc-refcell-groundstation.rs, uses Rc<RefCell<T>> to permit mutation within an object marked as immutable.

This allows two places to “share” ownership. NOTE Rc<T> is not thread-safe. In multithreaded code, it’s much better to replace Rc<T> with Arc<T> and Rc<RefCell<T>> with Arc<Mutex<T>>. Arc stands for atomic reference counter.

The type system—not the CPU—is what makes this dis- tinction. The following shows the listing’s output: a: 1100001111000011 50115 b: 1100001111000011 -15421  1 fn main() {  2   let a: u16 = 50115;  3   let b: i16 = -15421;  4   5   println!(\"a: {:016b} {}\", a, a);     6   println!(\"b: {:016b} {}\", b, b);     7 } The different mapping between bit strings and numbers explains part of the distinc- tion between binary files and text files. Text files are just binary files that happen to follow a consistent mapping between bit strings and characters. This mapping is called an encoding. Arbitrary files don’t describe their meaning to the outside world, which makes these opaque.  We can take this process one step further. What happens if we ask Rust to treat a bit pattern produced by one type as another? The following listing provides an answer. The source code for this listing is in ch5/ch5-f32-as-u32.rs.  1 fn main() {  2   let a: f32 = 42.42;  3   let frankentype: u32 = unsafe {  4     std::mem::transmute(a)         5   };  6   7   println!(\"{}\", frankentype);      8   println!(\"{:032b}\", frankentype);     9  10   let b: f32 = unsafe { 11     std::mem::transmute(frankentype) 12   }; 13   println!(\"{}\", b); 14   assert_eq!(a, b);    15 } When compiled and run, the code from listing 5.2 produces the following output: 1110027796 01000010001010011010111000010100 42.42 Listing 5.1 The data type determines what a sequence of bits represents Listing 5.2 Interpreting a float’s bit string as an integer These two values have  the same bit pattern  but different types.

       "  'text': '139 Life of an integer Some further remarks about some of the unfamiliar Rust that listing 5.2 introduces includes the following: \\uf0a1Line 8 demonstrates a new directive to the println!() macro: {:032b}. The 032 reads as “left-pad with 32 zeros” and the right-hand b invokes the std::fmt::Binary trait. This contrasts with the default syntax ({}), which invokes the std::fmt ::Display trait, or the question mark syntax ({:?}), which invokes std::fmt:: Debug. Unfortunately for us, f32 doesn’t implement std::fmt::Binary. Luckily, Rust’s integer types do. There are two integer types guaranteed to take up the same number of bits as f32—i32 and u32. The decision about which to choose is somewhat arbitrary. \\uf0a1Lines 3–5 perform the conversion discussed in the previous bulleted point. The std:: mem::transmute() function asks Rust to naïvely interpret an f32 as an u32 with- out affecting any of the underlying bits. The inverse conversion is repeated later on lines 10–12. Mixing data types in a program is inherently chaotic, so we need to wrap these opera- tion within unsafe blocks. unsafe tells the Rust compiler, “Stand back, I’ll take care of things from here. I’ve got this.” It’s a signal to the compiler that you have more con- text than it does to verify the correctness of the program.  Using the unsafe keyword does not imply that code is inherently dangerous. For example, it does not allow you to bypass Rust’s borrow checker. It indicates that the compiler is not able to guarantee that the program’s memory is safe by itself. Using unsafe means that the programmer is fully responsible for maintaining the program’s integrity. WARNING Some functionality allowed within unsafe blocks is more difficult to verify than others. For example, the std::mem::transmute() function is one of the least safe in the language. It shreds all type safety. Investigate alter- natives before using it in your own code. Needlessly using unsafe blocks is heavily frowned upon within the Rust community. It can expose your software to critical security vulnerabilities. Its primary purpose is to allow Rust to interact with external code, such as libraries written in other languages and OS interfaces. This book uses unsafe more frequently than many projects because its code examples are teaching tools, not industrial software. unsafe allows you to peek at and poke at individual bytes, which is essential knowledge for people seeking to understand how computers work.  5.2 Life of an integer During earlier chapters, we spent some time discussing what it means for an integer to be an i32, an u8, or an usize. Integers are like small, delicate fish. They do what they do remarkably well, but take them outside of their natural range and they die a quick, painful death.'},\n",

Unlike floating-point numbers, integers can- not sacrifice their precision to extend their bounds. Once those bits have been filled with 1s, the only way forward is back to all 0s.  A 16-bit integer can represent numbers between 0 and 65,535, inclusive. What hap- pens when you want to count to 65,536? Let’s find out.  The technical term for the class of problem that we are investigating is integer over- flow. One of the most innocuous ways of overflowing an integer is by incrementing for- ever. The following listing (ch5/ch5-to-oblivion.rs) is a trivial example of this.  1 fn main() {  2   let mut i: u16 = 0;  3   print!(\"{}..\", i);  4   5   loop {  6       i += 1000;  7       print!(\"{}..\", i);  8       if i % 10000 == 0 {  9           print!{\"\\\\n\"} 10       } 11   } 12 } When we try to run listing 5.3, things don’t end well for our program. Let’s look at the output: $ rustc ch5-to-oblivion.rs && ./ch5-to-oblivion  0..1000..2000..3000..4000..5000..6000..7000..8000..9000..10000.. 11000..12000..13000..14000..15000..16000..17000..18000..19000..20000.. 21000..22000..23000..24000..25000..26000..27000..28000..29000..30000.. 31000..32000..33000..34000..35000..36000..37000..38000..39000..40000.. 41000..42000..43000..44000..45000..46000..47000..48000..49000..50000.. 51000..52000..53000..54000..55000..56000..57000..58000..59000..60000.. thread \\'main\\' panicked at \\'attempt to add with overflow\\',                           ch5-to-oblivion.rs:5:7 note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable       to display a backtrace 61000..62000..63000..64000..65000.. A panicked program is a dead program. Panic means that the programmer has asked the program to do something that’s impossible. It doesn’t know what to do to proceed and shuts itself down.  To understand why this is such a critical class of bugs, let’s take a look at what’s going on under the hood. Listing 5.4 (ch5/ch5-bit-patterns.rs) prints six numbers with their bit patterns laid out in literal form. When compiled, the listing prints the following short line: 0, 1, 2, ..., 65533, 65534, 65535 Listing 5.3 Exploring the effect of incrementing an integer past its range'},\n",

The problem we’re interested in is what happens when there’s no more bits left. 65,536 cannot be represented by u16. fn main() {   let zero: u16 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0000;   let one:  u16 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0001;   let two:  u16 = 0b0000_0000_0000_0010;   // ...   let sixtyfivethousand_533: u16 = 0b1111_1111_1111_1101;   let sixtyfivethousand_534: u16 = 0b1111_1111_1111_1110;   let sixtyfivethousand_535: u16 = 0b1111_1111_1111_1111;   print!(\"{}, {}, {}, ..., \", zero, one, two);   println!(\"{}, {}, {}\", sixty5_533, sixty5_534, sixty5_535); } There is another (easy) way to kill a program using a similar technique. In listing 5.5, we ask Rust to fit 400 into an u8, which can only count up to 255 values. Look in ch5/ ch5-impossible-addition.rs for the source code for this listing. #[allow(arithmetic_overflow)]     fn main() {   let (a, b) = (200, 200);   let c: u8 = a + b;              println!(\"200 + 200 = {}\", c); } The code compiles, but one of two things happen: \\uf0a1The program panics: thread \\'main\\' panicked at \\'attempt to add with overflow\\',    5-impossible-add.rs:3:15 note: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for a backtrace This behavior can be invoked via executing rustc with its default options: rustc ch5-impossible-add.rs && ch5-impossible-add. \\uf0a1The program gives you the wrong answer: 200 + 200 = 144 This behavior can be invoked by executing rustc with the -O flag: rustc -O ch5-impossible-add.rs && ch5-impossible-add.

       "  'text': '142 CHAPTER 5 Data in depth There are two small lessons here: \\uf0a1It’s important to understand the limitations of your types. \\uf0a1Despite Rust’s strengths, programs written in Rust can still break. Developing strategies for preventing integer overflow is one of the ways that system programmers are distinguished from others. Programmers who only have experience with dynamic languages are extremely unlikely to encounter an integer overflow. Dynamic languages typically check to see that the results of integer expressions will fit. When these can’t, the variable that’s receiving the result is promoted to a wider inte- ger type.  When developing performance critical code, you get to choose which parameters to adjust. If you use fixed-sized types, you gain speed, but you need to accept some risk. To mitigate the risk, you can check to see that overflow won’t occur at runtime. Imposing those checks will slow you down, however. Another, much more common option, is to sacrifice space by using a large integer type, such as i64. To go higher still, you’ll need to move to arbitrarily sized integers, which come with their own costs. 5.2.1 Understanding endianness CPU vendors argue about how the individual bytes that make up integers should be laid out. Some CPUs order multibyte sequences left to right and others are right to left. This characteristic is known as a CPU’s endianness. The is one of the reasons why copying an executable file from one computer to another might not work.  Let’s consider a 32-bit integer that represents a number made up of four bytes: AA, BB, CC, and DD. Listing 5.6 (ch5/ch5-endianness.rs), with the help of our friend sys::mem::transmute(), demonstrates that byte order matters. When compiled and executed, the code from listing 5.6 prints one of two things, depending on the endi- anness of your machine. Most computers that people run for day-to-day work print the following:1 -573785174 vs. -1430532899 But more exotic hardware swaps the two numbers around like this: -1430532899 vs. -573785174 use std::mem::transmute; fn main() {   let big_endian: [u8; 4]    = [0xAA, 0xBB, 0xCC, 0xDD];   let little_endian: [u8; 4] = [0xDD, 0xCC, 0xBB, 0xAA]; 1 In 2021, the x86-64/AMD64 CPU architecture is dominant.

To take you back to when you learned addition, we can factor the number 123 into three parts: Summing all of these parts gets us back to our original number. The first part, 100, is labeled as the most significant. When written out in the conventional way, 123 as 123, we are writing in big endian format. Were we to invert that ordering by writing 123 as 321, we would be writing in little endian format.  Binary numbers work in a similar way. Each number part is a power of 2 (20, 21, 22,…, 2n), rather than a power of 10 (100, 101, 102,…, 10n).  Before the late-1990s, endianness was a big issue, especially in the server market. Glossing over the fact that a number of processors can support bidirectional endian- ness, Sun Microsystems, Cray, Motorola, and SGI went one way. ARM decided to hedge its bet and developed a bi-endian architecture. Intel went the other way. The other way won. Integers are almost certainly stored in little endian format.  In addition to multibyte sequences, there is a related problem within a byte. Should an u8 that represents 3 look like 0000_0011, or should it look like 1100_0000? The computer’s preference for layout of individual bits is known as its bit numbering or bit endianness. It’s unlikely, however, that this internal ordering will affect your day-to- day programming. To investigate further, look for your platform’s documentation to find out on which end its most significant bit lies. NOTE The abbreviation MSB can be deceptive. Different authors use the same abbreviation to refer to two concepts: most significant bit and most sig- nificant byte. To avoid confusion, this text uses the term bit numbering to refer to the most significant bit and endianness to refer to most significant byte.  5.3 Representing decimal numbers One of the claims made at the start of this chapter was that understanding more about bit patterns enables you to compress your data. Let’s put that into practice. In this sec- tion, you will learn how to pull bits out of a floating-point number and inject those into a single byte format of your own creation.  Here is some context for the problem at hand. Machine learning practitioners often need to store and distribute large models. A model for our purposes here is just 100 × 1 100 10 × 2 20 1 × 3 3 std::mem::transmute()  instructs the compiler to  interpret its argument as  the type on the left (i32).'},\n",

The numbers within those models often fall within the ranges 0..=1 or -1..=1 (using Rust’s range syntax), depending on the application. Given that we don’t need the whole range that f32 or f64 supports, why use all of these bytes? Let’s see how far we can get with 1. Because there is a known limited range, it’s possible to create a decimal number format that can model that range compactly.  To start, we’re going to need to learn about how decimal numbers are represented inside today’s computers. This means learning about the internals of floating-point numbers.  5.4 Floating-point numbers Each floating-point number is laid out in memory as scientific notation. If you’re unfa- miliar with scientific notation, here is a quick primer.  Scientists describe the mass of Jupiter as 1.898 × 1027 kg and the mass of an ant as 3.801 × 10–4 kg. The key insight is that the same number of characters are used to describe vastly different scales. Computer scientists have taken advantage of that insight to create a fixed-width format that encodes a wide range of numbers. Each position within a number in scientific notation is given a role: \\uf0a1A sign, which is implied in our two examples, would be present for negative numbers (negative infinity to 0). \\uf0a1The mantissa, also known as the significand, can be thought of as being the value in question (1.898 and 3.801, for example). \\uf0a1The radix, also known as the base, is the value that is raised to the power of the exponent (10 in both of our examples). \\uf0a1The exponent describes the scale of the values (27 and –4). This crosses over to floating point quite neatly. A floating-point value is a container with three fields: \\uf0a1A sign bit \\uf0a1An exponent \\uf0a1A mantissa Where is the radix? The standard defines it as 2 for all floating-point types. This defini- tion allows the radix to be omitted from the bit pattern itself. 5.4.1 Looking inside an f32 Figure 5.1 presents the memory layout of the f32 type in Rust. The layout is called binary32 within the IEEE 754-2019 and IEEE 754-2008 standards and single by their predecessor, IEE 754-1985.   The  value  42.42  is  encoded  as  f32  with  the  bit  pattern 01000010001010011010111000010100. That bit pattern is more compactly repre- sented as 0x4229AE14.

The following equation decodes the fields of a floating-point number into a single number. Variables from the standard (Radix, Bias) appear in title case.

First, perform a right shift to overwrite the mantissa’s bits (>> 23). Then use an AND mask (& 0xff) to exclude the sign bit.  The exponent’s bits also need to go through a decoding step. To decode the expo- nent, interpret its 8 bits a signed integer, then subtract 127 from the result. (As dis- cussed in section 5.3.2, 127 is known as the bias.) The following listing shows the code that describes the steps given in the last two paragraphs.

However, it’s actually not necessary to do so because the following decoding steps can simply ignore bits as irrelevant. Unfortunately, the man- tissa’s decoding step is significantly more complex than the exponent’s.  To decode the mantissa’s bits, multiply each bit by its weight and sum the result. The first bit’s weight is 0.5, and each subsequent bit’s weight is half of the current weight; for example, 0.5 (2–1), 0.25 (2–2),…, 0.00000011920928955078125 (2–23). An implicit 24th bit that represents 1.0 (2–0) is always considered to be on, except when special cases are triggered. Special cases are triggered by the state of the exponent: \\uf0a1When the exponent’s bits are all 0s, then the treatment of mantissa’s bits changes to repre- sent subnormal numbers (also known as “denormal numbers”). In practical terms, this change increases the number of decimal numbers near zero that can be repre- sented. Formally, a subnormal number is one between 0 and the smallest num- ber that the normal behavior would otherwise be able to represent. \\uf0a1When the exponent’s bits are all 1s, then the decimal number is infinity (\\uf0a5), negative infinity (–\\uf0a5), or Not a Number (NAN). NAN values indicate special cases where the numeric result is mathematically undefined (such as 0 ÷ 0) or that are other- wise invalid. Operations involving NAN values are often counterintuitive. For example, testing whether two values are equal is always false, even when the two bit pat- terns are exactly the same. An interesting curiosity is that f32 has approximately 4.2 million (~222) bit patterns that represent NAN. The following listing provides the code that implements nonspecial cases.  1 let n: f32 = 42.42;  2 let n_bits: u32 = n.to_bits();  3 let mut mantissa: f32 = 1.0;  4   5 for i in 0..23 {  6     let mask = 1 << i;  7     let one_at_bit_i = n_bits & mask;  8     if one_at_bit_i != 0 {  9         let i_ = i as f32; 10         let weight = 2_f32.powf( i_ - 23.0 ); 11         mantissa += weight; 12     } 13 } Repeating that process slowly: 1 Start with an f32 value:  1 let n: f32 = 42.42; Listing 5.9 Isolating and decoding the mantissa from an f32'},\n",

To convert the bits within a floating-point number to a number, there are three tasks: 1 Extract the bits of those values from the container (to_parts() on lines 1–26) 2 Decode each value from its raw bit pattern to its actual value (decode() on lines 28–47) 3 Perform the arithmetic to convert from scientific notation to an ordinary num- ber (from_parts() on lines 49–55) When we run listing 5.10, it provides two views of the internals of the number 42.42 encoded as an f32: 42.42 -> 42.42 field    |  as bits | as real number sign     |        0 | 1 exponent | 10000100 | 32 mantissa | 01010011010111000010100 | 1.325625 In listing 5.10, deconstruct_f32() extracts each field of a floating-point value with bit manipulation techniques. decode_f32_parts() demonstrates how to convert those fields to the relevant number. The f32_from_parts() method combines these to create a single decimal number. The source for this file is located in ch5/ch5-visualizing-f32.rs. Parsing Rust’s floating-point literals is harder than it looks Rust’s numbers have methods. To return the nearest integer to 1.2, Rust uses the method 1.2_f32.ceil() rather than the function call ceil(1.2). While often con- venient, this can cause some issues when the compiler parses your source code. For example, unary minus has lower precedence than method calls, which means unexpected mathematical errors can occur. It is often helpful to use parentheses to make your intent clear to the compiler. To calculate –10, wrap 1.0 in parentheses (-1.0_f32).powf(0.0) rather than -1.0_f32.powf(0.0) which is interpreted as –(10). Because both –10 and –(10) are mathematically valid, Rust will not complain when parentheses are omitted.'},\n",

These can be useful for representing fractions and are an option for performing calculations on CPUs without a floating point unit (FPU), such as micro- controllers. Unlike floating-point numbers, the decimal place does not move to dynami- cally accommodate different ranges. In our case, we’ll be using a fixed-point number format to compactly represent values between –1..=1. Although it loses accuracy, it saves significant space.2  The Q format is a fixed-point number format that uses a single byte.3 It was cre- ated by Texas Instruments for embedded computing devices. The specific version of the Q format that we will implement is called Q7. This indicates that there are 7 bits available for the represented number plus 1 sign bit. We’ll disguise the decimal nature of the type by hiding the 7 bits within an i8. That means that the Rust com- piler will be able to assist us in keeping track of the value’s sign. We will also be able to derive traits such as PartialEq and Eq, which provide comparison operators for our type, for free.  The following listing, an extract from listing 5.14, provides the type’s definition. You’ll find the source in ch5/ch5-q/src/lib.rs.  1 #[derive(Debug,Clone,Copy,PartialEq,Eq)]  2 pub struct Q7(i8);     A struct created from unnamed fields (for example, Q7(i8)), is known as a tuple struct. It offers a concise notation when the fields are not intended to be accessed directly. While not shown in listing 5.11, tuple structs can include multiple fields by adding fur- ther types separated by commas. As a reminder, the #[derive(…)] block asks Rust to implement several traits on our behalf:   2 This practice is known as quantizing the model in the machine learning community. 3 Q, often written as ℚ (this style is called blackboard bold), is the mathematical symbol for the so-called rational numbers. Rational numbers are numbers that can be represented as a fraction of two integers, such as 1/3. Listing 5.11 Definition of the Q7 format Q7 is a tuple struct.'},\n",

This can be derived because i8 implements the Clone trait. \\uf0a1 Copy—Enables cheap and implicit duplications where ownership errors might otherwise occur. Formally, this changes Q7 from a type that uses move semantics to one that uses copy semantics. \\uf0a1 PartialEq—Enables Q7 values to be compared with the equality operator (==). \\uf0a1 Eq—Indicates to Rust that all possible Q7 values can be compared against any other possible Q7 value. Q7 is intended as a compact storage and data transfer type only. Its most important role is to convert to and from floating-point types.

In the listing \\uf0a1Lines 4 and 18 introduce the impl From<T> for U blocks. The std::convert ::From trait is included in local scope as From, which is part of the standard prelude. It requires type U to implement from() that takes a T value as its sole argument.

For type conversions that can fail, consider implementing the std::convert ::TryFrom trait instead. We can also quickly implement converting from f32 to Q7 using the From<f64> imple- mentation that we’ve just seen. The following listing, an extract from listing 5.14, shows this conversion. Its source is in ch5/ch5-q/src/lib.rs. 22 impl From<f32> for Q7 { 23     fn from (n: f32) -> Self { 24         Q7::from(n as f64)      25     } 26 } 27  28 impl From<Q7> for f32 { 29     fn from(n: Q7) -> f32 { 30         f64::from(n) as f32     31     } 32 } Now, we’ve covered both floating-point types.

To keep the examples sim- ple, however, this book does not make heavy use of its system. But here are some basic guidelines: \\uf0a1Modules are combined into crates. \\uf0a1Modules can be defined by a project’s directory structure. Subdirectories under src/ become a module when that directory contains a mod.rs file. \\uf0a1Modules can also be defined within a file with the mod keyword. \\uf0a1Modules can be nested arbitrarily. \\uf0a1All members of a module including its submodules are private by default.

Imagine that you have a source of random bytes (u8), and you want to convert one of those into a floating-point (f32) value between 0 and 1. Naively interpreting the incoming bytes as f32/f64 via mem::transmute results in massive vari- ations in scale. The following listing demonstrates the division operation that gener- ates an f32 value that lies between 0 and 1 from an arbitrary input byte. fn mock_rand(n: u8) -> f32 {     (n as f32) / 255.0     } As division is a slow operation, perhaps there is something faster than simply dividing by the largest value that a byte can represent. Perhaps it’s possible to assume a con- stant exponent value, then shift the incoming bits into the mantissa, such that these would form a range between 0 and 1. Listing 5.16 with bit manipulation is the best result that I could achieve.  With an exponent of –1 represented as 0b01111110 (126 in base 10), the source byte achieves a range of 0.5 to 0.998. That can be normalized to 0.0 to 0.996 with sub- traction and multiplication. But is there a better way to do this?  1 fn mock_rand(n: u8) -> f32 {  2   3     let base: u32 = 0b0_01111110_00000000000000000000000;  4   5     let large_n = (n as u32) << 15;     6   7     let f32_bits = base | large_n;        8   9     let m = f32::from_bits(f32_bits);    10  11     2.0 * ( m - 0.5 )    12 } \\uf0a1Prefix things that you want to make public with the pub keyword.

Operations and the data that is being operated on share the same encoding. This means that, as a general computing device, your com- puter can emulate other computers’ instruction sets by emulating those in software. While we cannot pull apart a CPU to see how it works, we can construct one with code.  After working through this section, you will learn how a computer operates at a fundamental level. This section shows how functions operate and what the term pointer means. We won’t have an assembly language; we’ll actually be programming directly in hex. This section also introduces you to another term you may have heard of in passing: the stack.  We’ll implement a subset of a system called CHIP-8, which was available to consum- ers in the 1970s. CHIP-8 was supported by a number of manufacturers, but it was fairly primitive even by the standards of that time. (It was created to write games rather than for commercial or scientific applications.)  One device that used the CHIP-8 CPU was the COSMAC VIP. It had a single-color display with a resolution of 64x32 (0.0002 megapixels), 2 KB RAM, 1.76 MHz CPU, and sold for $275 USD. Oh, and you needed to assemble the computer yourself. It also contained games programmed by the world’s first female game developer, Joyce Weisbecker. Listing 5.17 Generating an f32 value without division'},\n",

Let’s first construct an emulator that only supports a single instruction: addition. To understand what’s hap- pening within listing 5.22 later in this section, there are three main things to learn: \\uf0a1Becoming familiar with new terminology \\uf0a1How to interpret opcodes \\uf0a1Understanding the main loop TERMS RELATED TO CPU EMULATION Dealing with CPUs and emulation involves learning some terms. Take a moment to look at and understand the following: \\uf0a1An operation (often shortened to “op”) refers to procedures that are supported natively by the system. You might also encounter equivalent phrases such as implemented in hardware or intrinsic operation as you explore further. \\uf0a1Registers are containers for data that the CPU accesses directly. For most operations, operands must be moved to registers for an operation to function. For the CHIP-8, each register is a u8 value. \\uf0a1An opcode is a number that maps to an operation. On the CHIP-8 platform, opcodes include both the operation and the operands’ registers.  DEFINING THE CPU The first operation that we want to support is addition. The operation takes two regis- ters (x and y) as operands and adds the value stored in y to x. To implement this, we’ll use the minimal amount of code possible, as the following listing shows. Our initial CPU contains only two registers and the space for a single opcode. struct CPU {     current_operation: u16,        registers: [u8; 2],     } So far, the CPU is inert. To perform addition, we’ll need to take the following steps, but there is no ability to store data in memory as yet: 1 Initialize a CPU. 2 Load u8 values into registers. 3 Load the addition opcode into current_operation. 4 Perform the operation. LOADING VALUES INTO REGISTERS The process for booting up the CPU consists of writing to the fields of the CPU struct. The following listing, an extract from listing 5.22, shows the CPU initialization process. Listing 5.18 Definition of the CPU used in listing 5.22 All CHIP-8 opcodes  are u16 values. These two registers are  sufficient for addition.'},\n",

UNDERSTANDING THE EMULATOR’S MAIN LOOP Now that we’ve loaded the data, the CPU is almost able to do some work. The run() method performs the bulk of our emulator’s work. Using the following steps, it emu- lates CPU cycles: 1 Reads the opcode (eventually, from memory) 2 Decodes instruction 3 Matches decoded instruction to known opcodes 4 Dispatches execution of the operation to a specific function The following listing, an extract from listing 5.22, shows the first functionality being added to the emulator.  6 impl CPU {  7   fn read_opcode(&self) -> u16 {     8     self.current_operation           9   }                                 10  11   fn run(&mut self) { 12     // loop {                 13       let opcode = self.read_opcode(); 14  15       let c = ((opcode & 0xF000) >> 12) as u8;    16       let x = ((opcode & 0x0F00) >>  8) as u8;    17       let y = ((opcode & 0x00F0) >>  4) as u8;    18       let d = ((opcode & 0x000F) >>  0) as u8;    19  20       match (c, x, y, d) { 21           (0x8, _, _, 0x4) => self.add_xy(x, y),    Listing 5.19 Initializing the CPU Listing 5.20 Reading the opcode Initializes with a  no-op (do nothing) Registers can only  hold u8 values. read_opcode() becomes more  complex when we introduce  reading from memory.

This section provides a thorough explanation of the process used in the CHIP-8 and its naming conventions.  CHIP-8 opcodes are u16 values made up of 4 nibbles. A nibble is half of a byte. That is, a nibble is a 4-bit value. Because there isn’t a 4-bit type in Rust, splitting the u16 val- ues into those parts is fiddly. To make matters more complicated, CHIP-8 nibbles are often recombined to form either 8-bit or 12-bit values depending on context.  To simplify talking about the parts of each opcode, let’s introduce some standard terminology. Each opcode is made up of two bytes: the high byte and the low byte. And each byte is made up of two nibbles, the high nibble and the low nibble, respectively. Fig- ure 5.2 illustrates each term. Documentation manuals for the CHIP-8 introduce several variables, including kk, nnn, x, and y. Table 5.2 explains their role, location, and width.

       "  'text': '162 CHAPTER 5 Data in depth There are three main forms of opcodes, as illustrated in figure 5.3. The decoding pro- cess involves matching on the high nibble of the first byte and then applying one of three strategies. To extract nibbles from bytes, we’ll need to use the right shift (>>) and logical AND (&) bitwise operations. These operations were introduced in section 5.4, especially in sections 5.4.1–5.4.3. The following listing demonstrates applying these bitwise opera- tions to the current problem. fn main() {   let opcode: u16 = 0x71E4;   let c = (opcode & 0xF000) >> 12;       let x = (opcode & 0x0F00) >>  8;       let y = (opcode & 0x00F0) >>  4;       let d = (opcode & 0x000F) >>  0;     nnn‡ 12 high byte, low nibble and low byte, both nibbles Memory address * n and d occupy the same location but are used in mutually exclusive contexts. † The variable names c and d are used within this book but not in other CHIP-8 documentation. ‡ Used in CPU RIA/3 (listing 5.29).

Which to use depends on  the value of the leftmost nibble. Select single nibbles with the AND operator (&)  to filter bits that should be retained, then shift  to move the bits to the lowest significant place.

When executed, it prints the following line: 5 + 10 = 15 5.7.3 CPU RIA/2: The Multiplier CPU RIA/1 can execute a single instruction: addition. CPU RIA/2, the Multiplier, can execute several instructions in sequence. The Multiplier includes RAM, a working main loop, and a variable that indicates which instruction to execute next that we’ll call position_in_memory. Listing 5.26 makes the following substantive changes to list- ing 5.22: \\uf0a1Adds 4 KB of memory (line 8). \\uf0a1Includes a fully-fledged main loop and stopping condition (lines 14–31). At each step in the loop, memory at position_in_memory is accessed and decoded into an opcode. position_in_memory is then incremented to the next memory address, and the opcode is executed. The CPU continues to run for- ever until the stopping condition (an opcode of 0x0000) is encountered. \\uf0a1Removes the current_instruction field of the CPU struct, which is replaced by a section of the main loop that decodes bytes from memory (lines 15–17). \\uf0a1Writes the opcodes into memory (lines 51–53). EXPANDING THE CPU TO SUPPORT MEMORY We need to implement some modifications to make our CPU more useful. To start, the computer needs memory.  Listing 5.23, an extract from listing 5.26, provides CPU RIA/2’s definition. CPU RIA/2 contains general-purpose registers for calculations (registers) and one special- purpose register (position_in_memory). For convenience, we’ll also include the sys- tem’s memory within the CPU struct itself as the memory field. 1 struct CPU { 2   registers: [u8; 16], Listing 5.23 Defining a CPU struct'},\n",

That allows all opcodes to be compactly represented as u16 values. \\uf0a1The CHIP-8 only has 4096 bytes of RAM (0x1000 in hexadecimal). This allows CHIP-8’s equivalent of a usize type to only be 12 bits wide: 212 = 4,096. Those 12 bits become the nnn variable discussed earlier. Rust in Action deviates from standard practice in two ways: \\uf0a1What we call the “position in memory” is normally referred to as the “program counter.” As a beginner, it can be difficult to remember what the program counter’s role is. So instead, this book uses a name that reflects its usage. \\uf0a1Within the CHIP-8 specification, the first 512 bytes (0x100) are reserved for the system, while other bytes are available for programs. This implementation relaxes that restriction.  READING OPCODES FROM MEMORY With the addition of memory within the CPU, the read_opcode() method requires updating. The following listing, an extract from listing 5.26, does that for us. It reads an opcode from memory by combining two u8 values into a single u16 value.  8 fn read_opcode(&self) -> u16 {  9   let p = self.position_in_memory; 10   let op_byte1 = self.memory[p] as u16; 11   let op_byte2 = self.memory[p + 1] as u16; 12  13   op_byte1 << 8 | op_byte2     14 } HANDLING INTEGER OVERFLOW Within the CHIP-8, we use the last register as a carry flag. When set, this flag indicates that an operation has overflowed the u8 register size. The following listing, an extract from listing 5.26, shows how to handle this overflow. 34 fn add_xy(&mut self, x: u8, y: u8) { 35   let arg1 = self.registers[x as usize]; 36   let arg2 = self.registers[y as usize]; 37  38   let (val, overflow) = arg1.overflowing_add(arg2);      39   self.registers[x as usize] = val; 40  Listing 5.24 Reading an opcode from memory Listing 5.25 Handling overflow in CHIP-8 operations Using usize rather that u16 diverges from  the original spec, but we’ll use usize as  Rust allows these to be used for indexing. To create a u16 opcode, we combine two values  from memory with the logical OR operation. These  need to be cast as u16 to start with; otherwise,  the left shift sets all of the bits to 0.  The overflowing_add()  method for u8 returns  (u8, bool). The bool is  true when overflow is  detected.'},\n",

This section adds the ability for you to call functions. There is no programming language support, however, so any programs still need to be written in binary. In addition to implementing functions, this section validates an assertion made at the start—functions are also data. EXPANDING THE CPU TO INCLUDE SUPPORT FOR A STACK To build functions, we need to implement some additional opcodes. These are as follows: \\uf0a1The CALL opcode (0x2nnn, where nnn is a memory address) sets position_ in_memory to nnn, the address of the function. \\uf0a1The RETURN opcode (0x00EE) sets position_in_memory to the memory address of the previous CALL opcode. To enable these to opcodes to work together, the CPU needs to have some specialized memory available for storing addresses. This is known as the stack. Each CALL opcode Initializes a few  registers with values Loads opcode 0x8014, which  adds register 1 to register 0 Loads opcode 0x8024, which  adds register 2 to register 0 Loads opcode 0x8034. which  adds register 3 to register 0'},\n",

The next few code snippets demonstrate how it is possible to move from a sequence of bytes, then convert that into executable code within CPU RIA/3. 1 Define the function. Our function performs two addition operations and then returns—modest, yet informative. It is three opcodes long. The function’s inter- nals look like this in a notation that resembles assembly language: add_twice:     0x8014     0x8014     0x00EE 2 Convert opcodes into Rust data types. Translating these three opcodes into Rust’s array syntax involves wrapping them in square brackets and using a comma for each number. The function has now become a [u16;3]: let add_twice: [u16;3] = [   0x8014,   0x8014,   0x00EE, ]; We want to be able to deal with one byte in the next step, so we’ll decompose the [u16;3] array further into a [u8;6] array: let add_twice: [u8;6] = [   0x80, 0x14,   0x80, 0x14,   0x00, 0xEE, ]; Listing 5.27 Including a stack and stack pointer 4 The sequence of bytes must also be tagged as executable. The tagging process is explained in section 6.1.4. The stack’s maximum height is 16.  After 16 nested function calls, the  program encounters a stack overflow.

Assuming that we wish to load that function into memory address 0x100, here are two options. First, if we have our function available as a slice, we can copy it across to memory with the copy_from_slice() method: fn main() {   let mut memory: [u8; 4096] = [0; 4096];   let mem = &mut memory;   let add_twice = [     0x80, 0x14,     0x80, 0x14,     0x00, 0xEE,   ];   mem[0x100..0x106].copy_from_slice(&add_twice);   println!(\"{:?}\", &mem[0x100..0x106]);    } An alternative approach that achieves the same effect within memory without requiring a temporary array is to overwrite bytes directly: fn main() {   let mut memory: [u8; 4096] = [0; 4096];   let mem = &mut memory;   mem[0x100] = 0x80; mem[0x101] = 0x14;   mem[0x102] = 0x80; mem[0x103] = 0x14;   mem[0x104] = 0x00; mem[0x105] = 0xEE;   println!(\"{:?}\", &mem[0x100..0x106]);    } The approach taken in the last snippet is exactly what is used within the main() func- tion of lines 96–98 of listing 5.29.

IMPLEMENTING THE CALL AND RETURN OPCODES Calling a function is a three-step process: 1 Store the current memory location on the stack. 2 Increment the stack pointer. 3 Set the current memory location to the intended memory address. Returning from a function involves reversing the calling process: 1 Decrement the stack pointer. 2 Retrieve the calling memory address from the stack. 3 Set the current memory location to the intended memory address.

Operat- ing systems and CPU architectures differ in calling conventions and in their capabil- ities. Sometimes operands will need to be added to the stack; sometimes they’ll need to be inserted into defined registers. Still, while the specific mechanics can differ, the process is roughly similar to what you have just encountered. Congratulations on making it this far.  5.7.5 CPU 4: Adding the rest With a few extra opcodes, it’s possible to implement multiplication and many more functions within your inchoate CPU. Check the source code that comes along with the book, specifically the ch5/ch5-cpu4 directory at https://github.com/rust-in-action/ code for a fuller implementation of the CHIP-8 specification.  The last step in learning about CPUs and data is to understand how control flow works. Within CHIP-8, control flow works by comparing values in registers, then mod- ifying position_in_memory, depending on the outcome. There are no while or for loops within a CPU. Creating these in programming languages is the art of the com- piler writer.  Summary \\uf0a1The same bit pattern can represent multiple values, depending on its data type. \\uf0a1Integer types within Rust’s standard library have a fixed width. Attempting to increment past an integer’s maximum value is an error called an integer over- flow. Decrementing past its lowest value is called integer underflow. \\uf0a1Compiling programs with optimization enabled (for example, via cargo build --release) can expose your programs to integer overflow and underflow as run-time checks are disabled. Sets opcode to 0x2100:  CALL the function at 0x100 Sets opcode to 0x2100:  CALL the function at 0x100 Sets opcode to 0x0000: HALT (not  strictly necessary as cpu.memory  is initialized with null bytes) Sets opcode to 0x8014: ADD  register 1’s value to register 0 Sets opcode to 0x8014: ADD  register 1’s value to register 0 Sets opcode to 0x00EE: RETURN'},\n",

A program compiled for a little-endian CPU malfunctions if one attempts to run it on a system with a big-endian CPU. \\uf0a1Decimal numbers are primarily represented by floating-point number types. The standard that Rust follows for its f32 and f64 types is IEEE 754. These types are also known as single precision and double precision floating point. \\uf0a1Within f32 and f64 types, identical bit patterns can compare as unequal (e.g., f32::NAN != f32::NAN), and differing bit patterns can compare as equal (e.g., -0 == 0). Accordingly, f32 and f64 only satisfy a partial equivalence relation. Pro- grammers should be mindful of this when comparing floating-point values for equality. \\uf0a1Bitwise operations are useful for manipulating the internals of data structures. However, doing so can often be highly unsafe. \\uf0a1Fixed-point number formats are also available.

Programmers who understand these dynamics can use that knowledge to maximize their programs’ performance, while minimizing their memory footprint.  Memory is a shared resource, and the OS is an arbiter. To make its life easier, the OS lies to your program about how much memory is available and where it’s located. Revealing the truth behind those lies requires us to work through some prior knowledge. This is the work of the first two sections of the chapter.

You’ll learn how to con- struct pointers, how to interact with an OS via its native API, and how to interact with other programs through Rust’s foreign function interface. 6.1 Pointers Pointers are how computers refer to data that isn’t immediately accessible. This topic tends to have an aura of mystique to it. That’s not necessary. If you’ve ever read a book’s table of contents, then you’ve used a pointer. Pointers are just numbers that refer to somewhere else.  If you’ve never encountered systems programming before, there is a lot of termi- nology to grapple with that describes unfamiliar concepts. Thankfully, though, what’s sitting underneath the abstraction is not too difficult to understand. The first thing to grasp is the notation used in this chapter’s figures. Figure 6.1 introduces three concepts: \\uf0a1The arrow refers to some location in memory that is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. \\uf0a1Each box represents a block of memory, and each block refers to a usize width. Other figures use a byte or perhaps even a bit as the chunk of memory these refer to. \\uf0a1The rounded box underneath the Value label represents three contiguous blocks of memory. For newcomers, pointers are scary and, at the same time, awe-inspiring. Their proper use requires that you know exactly how your program is laid out in memory. Imagine reading a table of contents that says chapter 4 starts on page 97, but it actually starts on page 107. That would be frustrating, but at least you could cope with the mistake.  A computer doesn’t experience frustration. It also lacks any intuition that it has pointed to the wrong place. It just keeps working, correctly or incorrectly, as if it had been given the correct location. The fear of pointers is that you will introduce some impossible-to-debug error. Pointers are typically denoted as arrows. Inside the computer, these are encoded as an integer (equivalent to usize), which is the memory adddress of their referent (the data that the pointer refers to). Pointer Value Figure 6.1 Depicting notation used in this chapter’s figures for  illustrating a pointer. In Rust, pointers are most frequently encountered  as &T and &mut T, where T is the type of the value.'},\n",

       "  'text': '177 Pointers  We can think of data stored within the program’s memory as being scattered around somewhere within physical RAM. To make use of that RAM, there needs to be some sort of retrieval system in place. An address space is that retrieval system.  Pointers are encoded as memory addresses, which are represented as integers of type usize. An address points to somewhere within the address space. For the moment, think of the address space as all of your RAM laid out end to end in a single line.  Why are memory addresses encoded as usize? Surely there’s no 64-bit computer with 264 bytes of RAM. The range of the address space is a façade provided by the OS and the CPU. Programs only know an orderly series of bytes, irrespective of the amount of RAM that is actually available in the system. We discuss how this works later in the virtual memory section of this chapter. NOTE Another interesting example is the Option<T> type. Rust uses null pointer optimization to ensure that an Option<T> occupies 0 bytes in the compiled binary. The None variant is represented by a null pointer (a pointer to invalid memory), allowing the Some(T) variant to have no additional indi- rection. What are the differences between references, pointers, and memory  addresses? References, pointers, and memory addresses are confusingly similar: \\uf0a1A memory address, often shortened to address, is a number that happens to refer to a single byte in memory. Memory addresses are abstractions provided by assembly languages. \\uf0a1A pointer, sometimes expanded to raw pointer, is a memory address that points to a value of some type. Pointers are abstractions provided by higher-level lan- guages. \\uf0a1A reference is a pointer, or in the case of dynamically sized types, a pointer and an integer with extra guarantees. References are abstractions provided by Rust. Compilers are able to determine spans of valid bytes for many types. For example, when a compiler creates a pointer to an i32, it can verify that there are 4 bytes that encode an integer. This is more useful than simply having a memory address, which may or may not point to any valid data type. Unfortunately, the programmer bears the responsibility for ensuring the validity for types with no known size at compile time. Rust’s references offer substantial benefits over pointers: \\uf0a1References always refer to valid data. Rust’s references can only be used when it’s legal to access their referent. I’m sure you’re familiar with this core tenet of Rust by now! \\uf0a1References are correctly aligned to multiples of usize. For technical reasons, CPUs become quite temperamental when asked to fetch unaligned memory.'},\n",

Rust in Action tries to stick to the following guidelines when discussing these types: \\uf0a1References—Signal that the Rust compiler will provide its safety guarantees. \\uf0a1Pointers—Refer to something more primitive. This also includes the implication that we are responsible for maintaining safety. (There is an implied connota- tion of being unsafe.) \\uf0a1Raw pointers—Used for types where it’s important to make their unsafe nature explicit. Throughout this section, we’ll expand on a common code fragment introduced by listing 6.1. Its source code is available in ch6/ch6-pointer-intro.rs. In the listing, two global variables, B and C, are pointed to by references. Those references hold the addresses of B and C, respectively. A view of what’s happening follows the code in fig- ures 6.2 and 6.3. static B: [u8; 10] = [99, 97, 114, 114, 121, 116, 111, 119, 101, 108]; static C: [u8; 11] = [116, 104, 97, 110, 107, 115, 102, 105, 115, 104, 0]; fn main() {     let a = 42;     let b = &B;        let c = &C;        println!(\"a: {}, b: {:p}, c: {:p}\", a, b, c);     } (continued) They operate much more slowly. To mitigate this problem, Rust’s types actu- ally include padding bytes so that creating references to these does not slow down your program. \\uf0a1References are able to provide these guarantees for dynamically sized types. For types with no fixed width in memory, Rust ensures that a length is kept alongside the internal pointer. That way Rust can ensure that the program never overruns the type’s space in memory. NOTE The distinguishing characteristic between memory addresses and the two higher abstractions is that the latter two have information about the type of their referent.  Listing 6.1 Mimicking pointers with references For simplicity, uses the same  reference type for this example.  Later examples distinguish smart  pointers from raw pointers and  require different types. The {:p} syntax asks  Rust to format the  variable as a pointer  and prints the memory  address that the value  points to.'},\n",

The other two are more interesting. b and c are references. These refer to two opaque arrays of data, B and C. For the moment, consider Rust references as equivalent to pointers.

It has a pointer width of two bytes (16 bits). You’ll notice that the variables b and c look different in memory, despite being the same type as in listing 6.1. That’s due to that because the listing is lying to you. The gritty details and a code example that more closely represents the diagram in figure 6.3 are coming shortly.  As evidenced in figure 6.2, there’s one problem with portraying pointers as arrows to disconnected arrays. These tend to de-emphasize that the address space is contigu- ous and shared between all variables.

It contains a number of new Rust features and some relatively arcane syntax, both of which haven’t been introduced yet. These will be explained shortly. use std::borrow::Cow;       use std::ffi::CStr;     use std::os::raw::c_char;    static B: [u8; 10] = [99, 97, 114, 114, 121, 116, 111, 119, 101, 108]; static C: [u8; 11] = [116, 104, 97, 110, 107, 115, 102, 105, 115, 104, 0]; fn main() {   let a = 42;        let b: String;      let c: Cow<str>;       unsafe {     let b_ptr = &B as *const u8 as *mut u8;             b = String::from_raw_parts(b_ptr, 10, 10);           let c_ptr = &C as *const u8 as *const c_char;         c = CStr::from_ptr(c_ptr).to_string_lossy();      }   println!(\"a: {}, b: {}, c: {}\", a, b, c); } In listing 6.3, Cow stands for copy on write. This smart pointer type is handy when an external source provides a buffer. Avoiding copies increases runtime performance. std::ffi is the foreign function interface module from Rust’s standard library. use std::os::raw::c_char; is not strictly needed, but it does make the code’s intent clear. C does not define the width of its char type in its standard, although it’s one byte wide in practice. Retrieving the type alias c_char from the std::os:raw module allows for differences. Listing 6.3 Printing from strings provided by external sources A smart pointer type that reads from its pointer location without needing to copy it first CStr is a C-like string type  that allows Rust to read in  zero-terminated strings. c_char, a type alias for Rust’s i8  type, presents the possibility of  a platform-specific nuances. Introduces each of the variables so that these are accessible  from println! later. If we created b and c within the unsafe  block, these would be out of scope later. String is a smart pointer  type that holds a pointer to  a backing array and a field  to store its size. Cow accepts a type parameter for  the data it points to; str is the type  returned by CStr.to_string_lossy(),  so it is appropriate here. References cannot be  cast directly to *mut T,  the type required by  String::from_raw_parts().  But *const T can be cast  to *mut T, leading to this  double cast syntax. String::from_raw_parts()  accepts a pointer (*mut T)  to an array of bytes, a size,  and a capacity parameter. Converts a *const u8 to a  *const i8, aliased to c_char.  The conversion to i8 works  because we remain under 128,  following the ASCII standard. Conceptually, CStr::from_ptr() takes responsibility for reading the pointer until it reaches 0; then it generates Cow<str> from the result.'},\n",

       "  'text': '183 Exploring Rust’s reference and pointer types  To thoroughly understand the code in listing 6.3, there is quite a bit of ground to cover. We first need to work through what raw pointers are and then discuss a number of feature-rich alternatives that have been built around them. 6.2.1 Raw pointers in Rust A raw pointer is a memory address without Rust’s standard guarantees. These are inher- ently unsafe. For example, unlike references (&T), raw pointers can be null.  If you’ll forgive the syntax, raw pointers are denoted as *const T and *mut T for immutable and mutable raw pointers, respectively. Even though each is a single type, these contain three tokens: *, const or mut. Their type, T, a raw pointer to a String, looks like *const String. A raw pointer to an i32 looks like *mut i32. But before we put pointers into practice, here are two other things that are useful to know: \\uf0a1The difference between a *mut T and a *const T is minimal. These can be freely cast between one another and tend to be used interchangeably, acting as in-source documentation. \\uf0a1Rust references (&mut T and &T) compile down to raw pointers. That means that it’s possible to access the performance of raw pointers without needing to venture into unsafe blocks. The next listing provides a small example that coerces a reference to a value (&T), cre- ating a raw pointer from an i64 value. It then prints the value and its address in mem- ory via the {:p} syntax. fn main() {     let a: i64 = 42;     let a_ptr = &a as *const i64;        println!(\"a: {} ({:p})\", a, a_ptr);    } The terms pointer and memory address are sometimes used interchangeably. These are integers that represent a location in virtual memory. From the compiler’s point of view, though, there is one important difference. Rust’s pointer types *const T and *mut T always point to the starting byte of T, and these also know the width of type T in bytes. A memory address might refer to anywhere in memory.  An i64 is 8-bytes wide (64 bits ÷ 8 bits per byte). Therefore, if an i64 is stored at address 0x7fffd, then each of the bytes between 0x7ffd..0x8004 must be fetched from RAM to recreate the integer’s value. The process of fetching data from RAM from a pointer is known as dereferencing a pointer. The following listing identifies a value’s address by casting a reference to it as a raw pointer via std::mem::transmute.   Listing 6.4 Creating a raw pointer (*const T) Casts a reference to the  variable a (&a) to a constant  raw pointer i64 (*const i64) Prints the value of the variable  a (42) and its address in  memory (0x7ff…)'},\n",

These come with extra guarantees and should always be preferred. WARNING Accessing the value of a raw pointer is always unsafe. Handle with care. Using raw pointers in Rust code is like working with pyrotechnics. Usually the results are fantastic, sometimes they’re painful, and occasionally they’re tragic. Raw pointers are often handled in Rust code by the OS or a third-party library.  To demonstrate their volatility, let’s work through a quick example with Rust’s raw pointers. Creating a pointer of arbitrary types from any integer is perfectly legal. Dereferencing that pointer must occur within an unsafe block, as the following snip- pet shows. An unsafe block implies that the programmer takes full responsibility for any consequences: fn main() {     let ptr = 42 as *const Vec<String>;         unsafe {         let new_addr = ptr.offset(4);         println!(\"{:p} -> {:p}\", ptr, new_addr);     } } To reiterate, raw pointers are not safe. These have a number of properties that mean that their use is strongly discouraged within day-to-day Rust code: \\uf0a1Raw pointers do not own their values. The Rust compiler does not check that the referent data is still valid when these are accessed. \\uf0a1Multiple raw pointers to the same data are allowed. Every raw pointer can have write, read-write access to data. This means that there is no time when Rust can guar- antee that shared data is valid. Notwithstanding those warnings, there are a small number of valid reasons to make use of raw pointers: Listing 6.5 Identifying a value’s address Interprets *const i64 as usize.  Using transmute() is highly unsafe  but is used here to postpone  introducing more syntax. You can create pointers safely from  any integral value. An i32 is not a  Vec<String>, but Rust is quite  comfortable ignoring that here.'},\n",

       "  'text': '185 Exploring Rust’s reference and pointer types \\uf0a1It’s unavoidable. Perhaps some OS call or third-party code requires a raw pointer. Raw pointers are common within C code that provides an external interface. \\uf0a1Shared access to something is essential and runtime performance is paramount. Perhaps multiple components within your application require equal access to some expensive-to-compute variable. If you’re willing to take on the risk of one of those components poisoning every other component with some silly mistake, then raw pointers are an option of last resort.  6.2.2 Rust’s pointer ecosystem Given that raw pointers are unsafe, what is the safer alternative? The alternative is to use smart pointers. In the Rust community, a smart pointer is a pointer type that has some kind of superpower, over and above the ability to deference a memory address. You will probably encounter the term wrapper type as well. Rust’s smart pointer types tend to wrap raw pointers and bestow them with added semantics.  A narrower definition of smart pointer is common in the C communities. There authors (generally) imply that the term smart pointer means the C equivalents of Rust’s core::ptr::Unique, core::ptr::Shared, and std::rc::Weak types. We will introduce these types shortly. NOTE The term fat pointer refers to memory layout. Thin pointers, such as raw pointers, are a single usize wide. Fat pointers are usually two usize wide, and occasionally more. Rust has an extensive set of pointer (and pointer-like) types in its standard library. Each has its own role, strengths, and weaknesses. Given their unique properties, rather than writing these out as a list, let’s model these as characters in a card-based role-playing game, as shown in figure 6.4.  Each of the pointer types introduced here are used extensively throughout the book. As such, we’ll give these fuller treatment when that’s needed. For now, the two novel attributes that appear within the Powers section of some of these cards are inte- rior mutability and shared ownership. These two terms warrant some discussion.  With interior mutability, you may want to provide an argument to a method that takes immutable values, yet you need to retain mutability. If you’re willing to pay the runtime performance cost, it’s possible to fake immutability. If the method requires an owned value, wrap the argument in Cell<T>. References can also be wrapped in RefCell<T>. It is common when using the reference counted types Rc<T> and Arc<T>, which only accept immutable arguments, to also wrap those in Cell<T> or Ref- Cell<T>. The resulting type might look like Rc<RefCell<T>>. This means that you pay the runtime cost twice but with significantly more flexibility.  With shared ownership, some objects, such as a network connection or, perhaps, access to some OS service, are difficult to mould into the pattern of having a single place with read-write access at any given time. Code might be simplified if two parts of'},\n",

       "  'text': '187 Providing programs with memory for their data research. Regardless, it might be useful to know that Rust’s pointer types are extensi- ble—these are designed with extension in mind.  All of the programmer-facing pointer types like Box<T> are built from more primi- tive types that live deeper within Rust, often in its core or alloc modules. Addition- ally, the C++ smart pointer types have Rust counterparts. Here are some useful starting points for you when building your own smart pointer types: \\uf0a1 core::ptr::Unique is the basis for types such as String, Box<T>, and the pointer field Vec<T>. \\uf0a1 core::ptr::Shared is the basis for Rc<T> and Arc<T>, and it can handle situa- tions where shared access is desired. In addition, the following tools can also be handy in certain situations: \\uf0a1Deeply interlinked data structures can benefit from std::rc::Weak and std::arc:: Weak for single and multi-threaded programs, respectively. These allow access to data within an Rc/Arc without incrementing its reference count. This can prevent never-ending cycles of pointers. \\uf0a1The alloc::raw_vec::RawVec type underlies Vec<T> and VecDeq<T>. An expand- able, double-ended queue that hasn’t appeared in the book so far, it under- stands how to allocate and deallocate memory in a smart way for any given type. \\uf0a1The std::cell::UnsafeCell type sits behind both Cell<T> and RefCell<T>. If you would like to provide interior mutability to your types, its implementation is worth investigating. A full treatment of building new safe pointers touches on some of Rust’s internals. These building blocks have their own building blocks. Unfortunately, explaining every detail will diverge too far from our goals for this chapter. NOTE Inquisitive readers should investigate the source code of the standard library’s pointer types. For example, the std::cell::RefCell type is docu- mented at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html. Clicking the [src] button on that web page directs you to the type’s definition.  6.3 Providing programs with memory for their data This section attempts to demystify the terms the stack and the heap. These terms often appear in contexts that presuppose you already know what they mean. That isn’t the case here. We’ll cover the details of what they are, why they exist, and how to make use of that knowledge to make your programs leaner and faster.  Some people hate wading through the details, though. For those readers, here is the salient difference between the stack and the heap: \\uf0a1The stack is fast. \\uf0a1The heap is slow. That difference leads to the following axiom: “When in doubt, prefer the stack.” To place data onto the stack, the compiler must know the type’s size at compile time.'},\n",

Think of a stack of dinner plates waiting in the cupboard of a commercial kitchen. Cooks are taking plates off the stack to serve food, and dishwashers are placing new plates on the top.  The unit (the plate) of a computing stack is the stack frame, also known as the allo- cation record. You are probably used to thinking of this as a group of variables and other data. Like many descriptions in computing, the stack and the heap are analogies that only partially fit. Even though the stack is often compared by analogy to a stack of din- ner plates waiting in the cupboard, unfortunately, that mental picture is inaccurate. Here are some differences: \\uf0a1The stack actually contains two levels of objects: stack frames and data. \\uf0a1The stack grants programmers access to multiple elements stored within it, rather than the top item only. \\uf0a1The stack can include elements of arbitrary size, where the implication of the dinner plate analogy is that all elements must be of the same size. So why is the stack called the stack? Because of the usage pattern. Entries on the stack are made in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.  The entries in the stack are called stack frames. Stack frames are created as function calls are made. As a program progresses, a cursor within the CPU updates to reflect the current address of the current stack frame. The cursor is known as the stack pointer.  As functions are called within functions, the stack pointer decreases in value as the stack grows. When a function returns, the stack pointer increases.  Stack frames contain a function’s state during the call. When a function is called within a function, the older function’s values are effectively frozen in time. Stack frames are also known as activation frames, and less commonly allocation records.1  Unlike dinner plates, every stack frame is a different size. The stack frame contains space for its function’s arguments, a pointer to the original call site, and local vari- ables (except the data which is allocated on the heap). NOTE If you are unfamiliar with what the term call site means, see the CPU emulation section in chapter 5. To understand what is happening more fully, let’s consider a thought experiment. Imagine a diligent, yet absurdly single-minded cook in a commercial kitchen. The cook takes each table’s docket and places those in a queue. The cook has a fairly bad memory, so each current order is written down a notebook. As new orders come in, 1 To be precise, the activation frame is called a stack frame when allocated on the stack.'},\n",

When orders are complete, the notebook page is changed to the next item in the queue. Unfortunately, for cus- tomers in this restaurant, the book operates in a LIFO manner. Hopefully, you will not be one of the early orders during tomorrow’s lunch rush.  In this analogy, the notebook plays the role of the stack pointer. The stack itself is comprised of variable-length dockets, representing stack frames. Like stack frames, restaurant dockets contain some metadata. For example, the table number can act as the return address.  The stack’s primary role is to make space for local variables. Why is the stack fast? All of a function’s variables are side by side in memory. That speeds up access. Improving the ergonomics of functions that can only accept String or &str As a library author, it can simplify downstream application code if your functions can accept both &str and String types. Unfortunately, these two types have different representations in memory. One (&str) is allocated on the stack, the other (String) allocates memory on the heap. That means that types cannot be trivially cast between one another. It’s possible, however, to work around this with Rust’s generics. Consider the example of validating a password. For the purposes of the example, a strong password is one that’s at least 6 characters long. The following shows how to validate the password by checking its length: fn is_strong(password: String) -> bool {     password.len() > 5 } is_strong can only accept String. That means that the following code won’t work: let pw = \"justok\"; let is_strong = is_strong(pw); But generic code can help. In cases where read-only access is required, use functions with the type signature fn x<T: AsRef<str>> (a: T) rather than fn x(a: String). The fairly unwieldy type signature reads “as function x takes an argument password of type T, where T implements AsRef<str>.” Implementors of AsRef<str> behave as a reference to str even when these are not. Here is the code snippet again for the previous listing, accepting any type T that implements AsRef<str>. It now has the new signature in place: fn is_strong<T: AsRef<str>>(password: T) -> bool {       password.as_ref().len() > 5 } When read-write access to the argument is required, normally you can make use of AsRef<T>\\'s sibling trait AsMut<T>. Unfortunately for this example, &\\'static str can- not become mutable and so another strategy can be deployed: implicit conversion. Provides a  String or a &str  as password'},\n",

What does it mean to have no known size at compile time? In Rust, there are two meanings. Some types grow and shrink over time as required. Obvious cases are String and Vec<T>. Other types are unable to tell the Rust compiler how much mem- ory to allocate even though these don’t change size at runtime. These are known as dynamically sized types. Slices ([T]) are the commonly cited example. Slices have no compile-time length. Internally, these are a pointer to some part of an array. But slices actually represent some number of elements within that array.  Another example is a trait object, which we’ve not described in this book so far. Trait objects allow Rust programmers to mimic some features of dynamic languages by allowing multiple types to be wedged into the same container. WHAT IS THE HEAP? You will gain a fuller understanding of what the heap is once you work through the next section on virtual memory. For now, let’s concentrate on what it is not. Once those points are clarified, we’ll then work our way back toward some form of truth.  The word “heap” implies disorganization. A closer analogy would be warehouse space in some medium-sized business. As deliveries arrive (as variables are created), the warehouse makes space available. As the business carries out its work, those mate- rials are used, and the warehouse space can now be made available for new deliveries. At times, there are gaps and perhaps a bit of clutter. But overall, there is a good sense of order.  Another mistake is that the heap has no relationship to the data structure that is also known as a heap. That data structure is often used to create priority queues. It’s an incredibly clever tool in its own right, but right now it’s a complete distraction. The heap is not a data structure. It’s an area of memory. (continued) It’s possible to ask Rust to accept only those types that can be converted to String. The following example performs that conversion within the function and applies any required business logic to that newly created String. This can circumvent the issue of &str being an immutable value. fn is_strong<T: Into<String>>(password: T) -> bool {     password.into().len() > 5 } This implicit conversion strategy does have significant risks, though. If a string-ified version of the password variable needs to be created multiple times in the pipeline, it would be much more efficient to require an explicit conversion within the calling application. That way the String would be created once and reused.'},\n",

       "  'text': '191 Providing programs with memory for their data  Now that those two distinctions are made, let’s inch toward an explanation. The critical difference from a usage point of view is that variables on the heap must be accessed via a pointer, whereas this is not required with variables accessed on the stack.  Although it’s a trivial example, let’s consider two variables, a and b. These both represent the integers 40 and 60, respectively. In one of those cases though, the inte- ger happens to live on the heap, as in this example: let a: i32 = 40; let b: Box<i32> = Box::new(60); Now, let’s demonstrate that critical difference. The following code won’t compile: let result = a + b; The boxed value assigned to b is only accessible via a pointer. To access that value, we need to dereference it. The dereference operator is a unary *, which prefixes the vari- able name: let result = a + *b; This syntax can be difficult to follow at first because the symbol is also used for multi- plication. It does, however, become more natural over time. The following listing shows a complete example where creating variables on the heap implies constructing that variable via a pointer type such as Box<T>. fn main() {     let a: i32 = 40;                 let b: Box<i32> = Box::new(60);         println!(\"{} + {} = {}\", a, b, a + *b);     } To get a feel for what the heap is and what is happening within memory as a program runs, let’s consider a tiny example. In this example, all we will do is to create some numbers on the heap and then add their values together. When run, the program in listing 6.7 produces some fairly trivial output: two 3s. Still, it’s really the internals of the program’s memory that are important here, not its results.  The code for the next listing is in the file ch6/ch6-heap-via-box/src/main.rs. A pictorial view of the program’s memory as it runs (figure 6.5) follows the code. Let’s first look at the program’s output: 3 3 Listing 6.6 Creating variables on the heap 40 lives on the stack. 60 lives on the heap. To access 60, we need  to dereference it.'},\n",

It contains some new or, at least, less familiar syntax that might be worthwhile to cover and/or recap: \\uf0a1 Box::new(T) allocates T on the heap. Box is a term that can be deceptive if you don’t share its intuition. Something that has been boxed lives on the heap, with a pointer to it on the stack. This is demonstrated in the first column of figure 6.5, where the number 0x100 at address 0xfff points to the value 1 at address 0x100. However, no actual box of bytes encloses a value, nor is the value hidden or concealed in some way. \\uf0a1 std::mem::drop brings the function drop() into local scope. drop() deletes objects before their scope ends. Types that implement Drop have a drop() method, but explicitly calling it is illegal within user code. std::mem::drop is an escape hatch from that rule. \\uf0a1Asterisks next to variables (*a, *b, *c, and *d) are unary operators. This is the derefer- ence operator. Dereferencing a Box::(T) returns T. In our case, the variables a, b, c, and d are references that refer to integers. In figure 6.5, each column illustrates what happens inside memory at 6 lines of code. The stack appears as the boxes along the top, and the heap appears along the bottom. The figure omits several details, but it should help you gain an intuition about the relationship between the stack and the heap. NOTE If you have experience with a debugger and want to explore what is happening, be sure to compile your code with no optimizations. Compile your code with cargo build (or cargo run) rather than cargo build --release. Using the --release flag actually ends up optimizing all the allocations and arithmetic. If you are invoking rustc manually, use the command rustc --codegen opt-level=0.

When the program would like more memory, it needs to ask for more from the OS. This is known as dynamic memory allocation and is shown in figure 6.6. Dynamic memory allocation is a three-step process: 1 Request memory from the OS via a system call. In the UNIX family of operating systems, this system call is alloc(). In MS Windows, the call is HeapAlloc(). 2 Make use of the allocated memory in the program. 3 Release memory that isn’t needed back to the OS via free() for UNIX systems and HeapFree() for Windows. As it turns out, there is an intermediary between the program and the OS: the alloca- tor, a specialist subprogram that is embedded in your program behind the scenes. It will often perform optimizations that avoid lots of work within the OS and CPU.  Let’s examine the performance impact of dynamic memory allocation and strate- gies to reduce that impact. Before starting, let’s recap why there’s a performance dif- ference between the stack and the heap. Remember that the stack and the heap are conceptual abstractions only. These do not exist as physical partitions of your com- puter’s memory. What accounts for their different performance characteristics?  Accessing data on the stack is fast because a function’s local variables, which are allocated on the stack, reside next to each other in RAM. This is sometimes referred to as a contiguous layout.  A contiguous layout is cache-friendly. Alternatively, variables allocated on the heap are unlikely to reside next to each other. Moreover, accessing data on the heap involves dereferencing the pointer. That implies a page table lookup and a trip to main memory. Table 6.1 summarizes these differences. Figure 6.6 Conceptual view of dynamic memory allocation. Requests  for memory originate and terminate at the program level but involve  several other components. At each stage, the components may short- circuit the process and return quickly.

       "  'text': '195 Providing programs with memory for their data There is a trade-off for the stack’s increased speed. Data structures on the stack must stay the same size during the lifetime of the program. Data structures allocated on the heap are more flexible. Because these are accessed via a pointer, that pointer can be changed.  To quantify this impact, we need to learn how to measure the cost. To get a large number of measurements, we need a program that creates and destroys many values. Let’s create a toy program. Figure 6.7 shows show a background element to a video game. After running listing 6.9, you should see a window appear on your screen filled with a dark grey background. White snow-like dots will start to float from the bottom and fade as they approach the top. If you check the console output, streams of numbers will appear.

Toward the end, the code example introduces Rust’s closure syntax. If you look at the call to window.draw_2d(), it has a second argument with vertical bars surrounding two variable names (|ctx, ren- derer, _device| { … }). Those vertical bars provide space for the closure’s arguments, and the curly braces are its body.  A closure is a function that is defined in line and can access variables from its sur- rounding scope. These are often called anonymous or lambda functions.  Closures are a common feature within idiomatic Rust code, but this book tends to avoid those where possible to keep examples approachable to programmers from an imperative or object-oriented background. Closures are explained fully in chapter 11. In the interim, it’s sufficient to say that these are a convenient shorthand for defining functions. Let’s next focus on generating some evidence that allocating variables on the heap (many millions of times) can have a performance impact on your code.  6.3.4 Analyzing the impact of dynamic memory allocation If you run listing 6.9 from a terminal window, you’ll soon see two columns of numbers filling it up. These columns represent the number of bytes allocated, and the duration in nanoseconds taken to fulfil the request. That output can be sent to a file for further'},\n",

The range of durations for allocating memory of the same number is over an order of magnitude. It might take 100 nanoseconds; it might take 1,000.  Does it matter? Probably not. But it might. If you have a 3 GHz CPU, then your processor is capable of performing 3 billion operations per second. If there is a 100 nanosecond delay between each of those operations, your computer can only perform 30 million operations in the same time frame. Perhaps those hundreds of microsec- onds really do count for your application. Some general strategies for minimizing heap allocations include \\uf0a1Using arrays of uninitialized objects. Instead of creating objects from scratch as required, create a bulk lot of those with zeroed values. When the time comes to activate one of those objects, set its values to non-zero.

You will be able to use this knowledge to speed up your programs by building software that goes with the grain. CPUs can compute faster when they’re able to access memory quickly. Understanding some of the dynamics of the computer architecture can help to provide CPUs with memory efficiently. 6.4.1 Background I have spent far too much of my life playing computer games. As enjoyable and chal- lenging as I’ve found these, I’ve often wondered about whether I would have been better off spending my teenage years doing something more productive. Still, it’s left me with plenty of memories. But some of those memories still leave a bitter taste.  Occasionally, someone would enter the game and obliterate everyone with near perfect aim and seemingly impossibly high health ratings. Other players would decry, “Cheater!” but were more or less helpless in defeat. While waiting in in-game purga- tory, I would sit wondering, “How is that possible? How are those tweaks to the game actually made?”  By working through this section’s examples, you would have built the core of a tool that’s capable of inspecting and modifying values of a running program. Terms related to virtual memory Terminology within this area is particularly arcane. It is often tied to decisions made many decades ago when the earliest computers were being designed. Here is a quick reference to some of the most important terms: \\uf0a1Page—A fixed-size block of words of real memory. Typically 4 KB in size for 64-bit operating systems. \\uf0a1Word—Any type that is size of a pointer. This corresponds to the width of the CPU’s registers. In Rust, usize and isize are word-length types. \\uf0a1Page fault—An error raised by the CPU when a valid memory address is requested that is not currently in physical RAM. This signals to the OS that at least one page must be swapped back into memory. \\uf0a1Swapping—Migrating a page of memory stored temporarily on disk from main memory upon request. \\uf0a1Virtual memory—The program’s view of its memory. All data accessible to a program is provided in its address space by the OS. \\uf0a1Real memory—The operating system’s view of the physical memory available on the system. In many technical texts, real memory is defined independently from physical memory, which becomes much more of an electrical engineer- ing term. \\uf0a1Page table—The data structure maintained by the OS to manage translating from virtual to real memory.'},\n",

       "  'text': '203 Virtual memory 6.4.2 Step 1: Having a process scan its own memory Intuitively, a program’s memory is a series of bytes that starts at location 0 and ends at location n. If a program reports 100 KB of RAM usage, it would seem that n would be somewhere near 100,000. Let’s test that intuition.  We’ll create a small command-line program that looks through memory, start- ing at location 0 and ending at 10,000. As it’s a small program, it shouldn’t occupy more than 10,000 bytes. But when executed, the program will not perform as intended. Sadly, it will crash. You’ll learn why the crash occurs as you follow through this section.  Listing 6.12 shows the command-line program. You can find its source in ch6/ch6- memscan-1/src/main.rs. The listing scans through a running program’s memory byte by byte, starting at 0. It introduces the syntax for creating raw pointers and derefer- encing (reading) those.  1 fn main() {  2     let mut n_nonzero = 0;  3   4     for i in 0..10000 {  5         let ptr = i as *const u8;      6         let byte_at_addr = unsafe { *ptr };     7   8         if byte_at_addr != 0 {  9             n_nonzero += 1; 10         } 11     } 12  13     println!(\"non-zero bytes in memory: {}\", n_nonzero); 14 } \\uf0a1Segment—A block within virtual memory. Virtual memory is divided into blocks to minimize the space required to translate between virtual and physical addresses. \\uf0a1Segmentation fault—An error raised by the CPU when an illegal memory address is requested. \\uf0a1MMU—A component of the CPU that manages memory address translation. Maintains a cache of recently translated addresses (called the TLB), which stands for the translation lookaside buffer, although that terminology has fallen from fashion. One term that has not been defined in any technical sense so far in this book is process. If you’ve encountered it before and have been wondering why it has been omitted, it will be introduced properly when we talk about concurrency. For now, con- sider the terms process and its peer operating system process to refer to a running program.  Listing 6.12 Attempting to scan a running program’s memory byte by byte Converts i to a *const T, a raw pointer  of type u8 to inspect raw memory  addresses. We treat every address as  a unit, ignoring the fact that most  values span multiple bytes. Dereferences the pointer, it  reads the value at address i.  Another way of saying this  is “read the value being  pointed to.”'},\n",

       "  'text': '204 CHAPTER 6 Memory Listing 6.12 crashes because it is attempting to dereference a NULL pointer. When i equals 0, ptr can’t really be dereferenced. Incidentally, this is why all raw pointer dereferences must occur within an unsafe block.  How about we attempt to start from a non-zero memory address? Given that the program is executable code, there should be at least several thousand bytes of non- zero data to iterate through. The following listing scans the process’s memory starting from 1 to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer.  1 fn main() {  2     let mut n_nonzero = 0;  3   4     for i in 1..10000 {       5         let ptr = i as *const u8;  6         let byte_at_addr = unsafe { *ptr };  7   8         if byte_at_addr != 0 {  9             n_nonzero += 1; 10         } 11     } 12  13     println!(\"non-zero bytes in memory: {}\", n_nonzero); 14 } This unfortunately does not completely solve the issue. Listing 6.13 still crashes upon execution, and the number of non-zero bytes is never printed to the console. This is due to what’s known as a segmentation fault.  Segmentation faults are generated when the CPU and OS detect that your pro- gram is attempting to access memory regions that they aren’t entitled to. Memory regions are divided into segments. That explains the name.  Let’s try a different approach. Rather than attempting to scan through bytes, let’s look for the addresses of things that we know exist. We’ve spent lots of time learning about pointers, so let’s put that to use. Listing 6.14 creates several values, examining their addresses.  Every run of listing 6.14 may generate unique values. Here is the output of one run: GLOBAL:    0x7ff6d6ec9310 local_str: 0x7ff6d6ec9314 local_int: 0x23d492f91c boxed_int: 0x18361b78320 boxed_str: 0x18361b78070 fn_int:    0x23d492f8ec As you can see, values appear to be scattered across a wide range. So despite your pro- gram (hopefully) only needing a few kilobytes of RAM, a few variables live in giant locations. These are virtual addresses.

In this run, the highest value is 0x7ff6d6ec9314. That’s approximately 264 ÷ 2. That number is due to the OS reserv- ing half of the address space for itself.  The following listing returns the address of several variables within a program to examine its address space. The source for this listing in ch6/ch6-memscan-3/src/ main.rs. static GLOBAL: i32 = 1000;     fn noop() -> *const i32 {     let noop_local = 12345;                &noop_local as *const i32     } fn main() {     let local_str = \"a\";                   let local_int = 123;                   let boxed_str = Box::new(\\'b\\');         let boxed_int = Box::new(789);         let fn_int = noop();                   println!(\"GLOBAL:    {:p}\", &GLOBAL as *const i32);     println!(\"local_str: {:p}\", local_str as *const str);     println!(\"local_int: {:p}\", &local_int as *const i32);     println!(\"boxed_int: {:p}\", Box::into_raw(boxed_int));     println!(\"boxed_str: {:p}\", Box::into_raw(boxed_str));     println!(\"fn_int:    {:p}\", fn_int);} By now, you should be pretty good at accessing addresses of stored values. There are actually two small lessons that you may have also picked up on: \\uf0a1Some memory addresses are illegal. The OS will shut your program down if it attempts to access memory that is out of bounds. \\uf0a1Memory addresses are not arbitrary. Although values seem to be spread quite far apart within the address space, values are clustered together within pockets. Before pressing on with the cheat program, let’s step back and look at the system that’s operating behind the scenes to translate these virtual addresses to real memory.  6.4.3 Translating virtual addresses to physical addresses Accessing data in a program requires virtual addresses—the only addresses that the program itself has access to. These get translated into physical addresses. This process involves a dance between the program, the OS, the CPU, the RAM hardware, and occasionally hard drives and other devices. The CPU is responsible for performing this translation, but the OS stores the instructions. Listing 6.14 Printing the address of variables within a program Creates a global static, which is a  global variable in Rust programs Creates a global static, which is a  global variable in Rust programs Creates a local variable within noop() so that  something outside of main() has a memory address Creates various values of  several types including  values on the heap'},\n",

       "  'text': '206 CHAPTER 6 Memory  CPUs contain a memory management unit (MMU) that is designed for this one job. For every running program, every virtual address is mapped to a physical address. Those instructions are stored at a predefined address in memory as well. That means, in the worst case, every attempt at accessing memory addresses incurs two memory lookups. But it’s possible to avoid the worst case.  The CPU maintains a cache of recently translated addresses. It has its own (fast) memory to speed up accessing memory. For historic reasons, this cache is known as the translation lookaside buffer, often abbreviated as TLB. Programmers optimizing for performance need to keep data structures lean and avoid deeply nested structures. Reaching the capacity of the TLB (typically around 100 pages for x86 processors) can be costly.  Looking into how the translation system operates reveals more, often quite com- plex, details. Virtual addresses are grouped into blocks called pages, which are typically 4 KB in size. This practice avoids the need to store a translation mapping for every single variable in every program. Having a uniform size for each page also assists in avoiding a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation, where pockets of empty, yet unusable, space appear within available RAM. NOTE This is a general guide only. The details of how the OS and CPU coop- erate to manage memory differs significantly in some environments. In par- ticular, constrained environments such as microcontrollers can use real addressing. For those interested in learning more, the research field is known as computer architecture. The OS and CPU can play some interesting tricks when data lives within pages of vir- tual memory. For example \\uf0a1Having a virtual address space allows the OS to overallocate. Programs that ask for more memory than the machine can physically provide are able to be accommodated. \\uf0a1Inactive memory pages can be swapped to disk in a byte-for-byte manner until it’s requested by the active program. Swapping is often used during periods of high contention for memory but can be used more generally, depending on an operating system’s whims. \\uf0a1Other size optimizations such as compression can be performed. A program sees its memory intact. Behind the scenes, the OS compresses the program’s wasteful data usage. \\uf0a1Programs are able to share data quickly. If your program requests a large block of zeroes, say, for a newly created array, the OS might point you towards a page filled with zeroes that is currently being used by three other programs. None of the programs are aware that the others are looking at the same physical mem- ory, and the zeroes have different positions within their virtual address space.'},\n",

       "  'text': '207 Virtual memory \\uf0a1Paging can speed up the loading of shared libraries. As a special case of the previ- ous point, if a shared library is already loaded by another program, the OS can avoid loading it into memory twice by pointing the new program to the old data. \\uf0a1Paging adds security between programs. As you discovered earlier in this section, some parts of the address space are illegal to access. The OS has other attributes that it can add. If an attempt is made to write to a read-only page, the OS termi- nates the program. Making effective use of the virtual memory system in day-to-day programs requires thinking about how data is represented in RAM. Here are some guidelines: \\uf0a1Keep hot working portions of your program within 4 KB of size. This maintains fast lookups. \\uf0a1If 4 KB is unreasonable for your application, then the next target to keep under is 4 KB * 100. That rough guide should mean that the CPU can maintain its translation cache (the TLB) in good order to support your program. \\uf0a1Avoid deeply nested data structures with pointer spaghetti. If a pointer points to another page, then performance suffers. \\uf0a1Test the ordering of your nested loops. CPUs read small blocks of bytes, known as a cache line, from the RAM hardware. When processing an array, you can take advantage of this by investigating whether you are doing column-wise or row- wise operations. One thing to note: virtualization makes this situation worse. If you’re running an app inside a virtual machine, the hypervisor must also translate addresses for its guest operating systems. This is why many CPUs ship with virtualization support, which can reduce this extra overhead. Running containers within virtual machines adds another layer of indirection and, therefore, latency. For bare-metal performance, run apps on bare metal. How does an executable file turn into a program’s virtual address space? The layout of executable files (aka binaries) has many similarities to the address space diagram that we saw earlier in the heap versus stack section of the chapter. While the exact process is dependent on the OS and file format, the following figure shows a representative example. Each of the segments of the address space that we have discussed are described by binary files. When the executable is started, the OS loads the right bytes into the right places. Once the virtual address space is created, the CPU can be told to jump to the start of the .text segment, and the program begins executing.'},\n",

As we’ve discovered, the OS maintains the instructions for mapping between a virtual address and a physical address. Can we ask the OS to tell us what is happening?  Operating systems provide an interface for programs to be able to make requests; this is known as a system call. Within Windows, the KERNEL.DLL provides the neces- sary functionality to inspect and manipulate the memory of a running process. NOTE Why Windows? Well, many Rust programmers use MS Windows as a platform. Also, its functions are well named and don’t require as much prior knowledge as the POSIX API. When you run listing 6.16, you should see lots of output with many sections. This may be similar to the following: MEMORY_BASIC_INFORMATION {                  BaseAddress: 0x00007ffbe8d9b000, (continued) File header: describes the ﬁle type Program header: describes the memory segments used by the program and their attributes Common segments: .bss Historic name  originally stood for ; Block Started by Symbol.

Rather than use a return value, this function makes use of a C idiom to provide its result to the caller.

This is essential for Just-In-Time compilers (JITs), debuggers, and programs to help people “cheat” at games. On Windows, the general process looks something like this in Rust-like pseudocode: let pid = some_process_id; OpenProcess(pid); loop address space {     *call* VirtualQueryEx() to access the next memory segment     *scan* the segment by calling ReadProcessMemory(),     looking for a selected pattern     *call* WriteProcessMemory() with the desired value } Linux provides an even simpler API via process_vm_readv() and process_vm_ writev(). These are analogous to ReadProcessMemory() and WriteProcessMemory() in Windows.  Memory management is a complicated area with many levels of abstraction to uncover. This chapter has tried to focus on those elements that are most salient to your work as a programmer. Now, when you read your next blog post on some low- level coding technique, you should be able to follow along with the terminology.  Summary \\uf0a1Pointers, references, and memory addresses are identical from the CPU’s per- spective, but these are significantly different at the programming language level. \\uf0a1Strings and many other data structures are implemented with a backing array pointed to by a pointer. \\uf0a1The term smart pointer refers to data structures that behave like pointers but have additional capabilities. These almost always incur a space overhead. Addi- tionally, data can include integer length and capacity fields or things that are more sophisticated, such as locks. \\uf0a1Rust has a rich collection of smart pointer types. Types with more features typi- cally incur greater runtime costs. \\uf0a1The standard library’s smart pointer types are built from building blocks that you can also use to define your own smart pointers if required. \\uf0a1The heap and the stack are abstractions provided by operating systems and pro- gramming languages. These do not exist at the level of the CPU. \\uf0a1Operating systems often provide mechanisms such as memory allocations to inspect a program’s behavior.'},\n",

To start with, however, let’s see if we can create patterns from the raw byte sequence within files. 7.1 What is a file format? File formats are standards for working with data as an single, ordered sequence of bytes. Storage media like hard disk drives work faster when reading or writing large blocks of data in serial. This contrasts with in-memory data structures, where data lay- out has less of an impact.  File formats live in a large design space with trade-offs in performance, human- readability, and portability. Some formats are highly portable and self-describing. Oth- ers restrict themselves to being accessible within a single environment and are unable to be read by third-party tools, yet they are high performance.  Table 7.1 illustrates some of the design space for file formats. Each row reveals the file format’s internal patterns, which are generated from the same source text. By color-coding each byte within the file, it’s possible to see structural differences between each representation. Table 7.1 The internals of four digital versions of William Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing produced by Project Gutenberg. The plain text version of the play contains printable char- acters only. These are indicated by dark grey for letters  and punctuation, and white for whitespace. Visually, the image appears to be noisy. It lacks internal  structure. That’s due to the variation in length of the natu- ral language that the file represents. A file with regular,  repeating structures, such as a file format designed to  hold arrays of floating-point numbers, tends to look quite  different. The EPUB format is actually a compressed ZIP archive  with a bespoke file extension. There are many bytes  within the file that fall out of the range of the printable  category as indicated by the mid-grey pixels. MOBI includes four bands of NULL bytes (0x00), repre- sented as black pixels. These bands probably represent  the result of an engineering trade-off. In some sense,  these empty bytes are wasted space. They’re probably  added as padding so that the file’s sections are easy to  parse later on. The other notable feature of this file is its size. It’s larger  than the other versions of the play. This might imply that  the file is harboring more data than just the text. Candi- dates include display elements like fonts, or encryption  keys that enforce anti-copying restrictions within the file.'},\n",

Despite this, many systems use plain text files for data storage. Configuration files, for example, are commonly designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable. The Rust ecosystem has excellent support for converting data to many on-disk formats. 7.2.1 Writing data to disk with serde and the bincode format The serde crate serializes and deserializes Rust values to and from many formats. Each format has its own strengths: many are human-readable, while others prefer to be compact so that they can be speedily sent across the network.  Using serde takes surprisingly little ceremony. As an example, let’s use statistics about the Nigerian city of Calabar and store those in multiple output formats. To start, let’s assume that our code contains a City struct. The serde crate provides the Serialize and Deserialize traits, and most code implements these with this derived annotation: #[derive(Serialize)]     struct City {     name: String,     population: usize,     latitude: f64,     longitude: f64, } Populating that struct with data about Calabar is straightforward. This code snippet shows the implementation: let calabar = City {     name: String::from(\"Calabar\"),     population: 470_000,     latitude: 4.95,     longitude: 8.33, }; The HTML file contains a high proportion of whitespace  characters. These are indicated by white pixels. Markup  languages like HTML tend to add whitespace to aid read- ability.

Table 7.2 provides an example. As you know from previous chapters, two hexadecimal numbers can represent all digits from 0 to 255, which is the number of bit patterns representable within a single byte. We’ll call our clone fview (short for file view). Unless you’re familiar with hexadecimal notation, the output from fview can be fairly opaque. If you’re experienced at looking at similar output, you may notice that there are no bytes above 0x7e (127). There are also few bytes less than 0x21 (33), with the exception of 0x0a (10). Ox0a represents the newline character (\\\\n). These byte pat- terns are markers for a plain text input source.  Listing 7.4 provides the source code that builds the complete fview. But because a few new features of Rust need to be introduced, we’ll take a few steps to get to the full program.  We’ll start with listing 7.3, which uses a string literal as input and produces the out- put in table 7.2. It demonstrates the use of multiline string literals, importing the std::io traits via std::io::prelude. This enables &[u8] types to be read as files via the std::io::Read trait.

       "  'text': '219 File operations in Rust Listing 7.4 introduces some new Rust. Let’s look at some of those constructs now: \\uf0a1 while let Ok(_) { … }— With this control-flow structure, the program con- tinues to loop until f.read_exact() returns Err, which occurs when it has run out of bytes to read. \\uf0a1 f.read_exact()—This method from the Read trait transfers data from the source (in our case, f) to the buffer provided as an argument. It stops when that buffer is full. f.read_exact() provides greater control to you as a programmer for managing memory than the chunks() option used in listing 7.3, but it comes with some quirks. If the buffer is longer than the number of available bytes to read, the file returns an error, and the state of the buffer is undefined. Listing 7.4 also includes some stylistic additions: \\uf0a1To handle command-line arguments without using third-party libraries, we make use of std::env::args(). It returns an iterator over the arguments provided to the program. Iterators have an nth() method, which extracts the element at the nth position. \\uf0a1Every iterator’s nth() method returns an Option. When n is larger than the length of the iterator, None is returned. To handle these Option values, we use calls to expect(). \\uf0a1The expect() method is considered a friendlier version of unwrap(). expect() takes an error message as an argument, whereas unwrap() simply panics abruptly. Using std::env::args() directly means that input is not validated. That’s a problem in our simple example, but is something to consider for larger programs.  7.4 File operations in Rust So far in this chapter, we have invested a lot of time considering how data is translated into sequences of bytes. Let’s spend some time considering another level of abstrac- tion—the file. Previous chapters have covered basic operations like opening and read- ing from a file. This section contains some other helpful techniques, which provide more granular control. 7.4.1 Opening a file in Rust and controlling its file mode Files are an abstraction that’s maintained by the operating system (OS). It presents a façade of names and hierarchy above a nest of raw bytes.  Files also provide a layer of security. These have attached permissions that the OS enforces. This (in principle, at least) is what prevents a web server running under its own user account from reading files owned by others.  std::fs::File is the primary type for interacting with the filesystem. There are two methods available for creating a file: open() and create(). Use open() when you know the file already exists. Table 7.3 explains more of their differences.'},\n",

Listing 7.16 provides a good example of a case where an append mode is requested. The application requires a writeable file that is also readable, and if it doesn’t already exist, it’s created. The fol- lowing shows an excerpt from listing 7.16 that demonstrates the use of std::fs:Open- Options to create a writeable file. The file is not truncated when it’s opened. let f = OpenOptions::new()            .read(true)               .write(true)                   .create(true)             .append(true)             .open(path)?;    7.4.2 Interacting with the filesystem in a type-safe manner with  std::fs::Path Rust provides type-safe variants of str and String in its standard library: std::path:: Path and std::path::PathBuf. You can use these variants to unambiguously work with path separators in a cross-platform way. Path can address files, directories, and related abstractions, such as symbolic links. Path and PathBuf values often start their lives as plain string types, which can be converted with the from() static method: let hello = PathBuf::from(\"/tmp/hello.txt\") From there, interacting with these variants reveals methods that are specific to paths: hello.extension()       Table 7.3 Creating File values in Rust and the effects on the underlying filesystem Method Return value when the  file already exists Effect on the  underlying file Return value when  no file exists File::open Ok(File)* Opened as is in read-only mode.

       "  'text': '221 File operations in Rust The full API is straightforward for anyone who has used code to manipulate paths before, so it won’t be fleshed out here. Still, it may be worth discussing why it’s included within the language because many languages omit this. NOTE As an implementation detail, std::fs::Path and std::fs::PathBuf are implemented on top of std::ffi::OsStr and std::ffi::OsString, respec- tively. This means that Path and PathBuf are not guaranteed to be UTF-8 compliant. Why use Path rather than manipulating strings directly? Here are some good reasons for using Path: \\uf0a1Clear intent—Path provides useful methods like set_extension() that describe the intended outcome. This can assist programmers who later read the code. Manipulating strings doesn’t provide that level of self-documentation. \\uf0a1Portability—Some operating systems treat filesystem paths as case-insensitive. Others don’t. Using one operating system’s conventions can result in issues later, when users expect their host system’s conventions to be followed. Addi- tionally, path separators are specific to operating systems and, thus, can differ. This means that using raw strings can lead to portability issues. Comparisons require exact matches. \\uf0a1Easier debugging—If you’re attempting to extract /tmp from the path /tmp/ hello.txt, doing it manually can introduce subtle bugs that may only appear at runtime. Further, miscounting the correct number of index values after split- ting the string on / introduces a bug that can’t be caught at compile time. To illustrate the subtle errors, consider the case of separators. Slashes are common in today’s operating systems, but those conventions took some time to become established: \\uf0a1 \\\\ is commonly used on MS Windows. \\uf0a1 / is the convention for UNIX-like operating systems. \\uf0a1 : was the path separator for the classic Mac OS. \\uf0a1 > is used in the Stratus VOS operating system. Table 7.4 compares the two strings: std::String and std::path::Path.

Let’s begin to lift the lid on database technology. Along the way, we’ll learn the internal architecture of a family of database systems using a log-structured, append-only model.  Log-structured, append-only database systems are significant as case studies because these are designed to be extremely resilient while offering optimal read performance. Despite storing data on fickle media like flash storage or a spinning hard disk drive, databases using this model are able to guarantee that data will never be lost and that backed up data files will never be corrupted. 7.5.1 The key-value model The key-value store implemented in this chapter, actionkv, stores and retrieves sequences of bytes ([u8]) of arbitrary length. Each sequence has two parts: the first is a key and the second is a value. Because the &str type is represented as [u8] internally, table 7.5 shows the plain text notation rather than the binary equivalent. The key-value model enables simple queries such as “What is the capital city of Fiji?” But it doesn’t support asking broader queries such as “What is the list of capital cities for all Pacific Island states?” 7.5.2 Introducing actionkv v1: An in-memory key-value store with a  command-line interface The first version of our key-value store, actionkv, exposes us to the API that we’ll use throughout the rest of the chapter and also introduces the main library code. The library code will not change as the subsequent two systems are built on top of it. Before we get to that code, though, there are some prerequisites that need to be covered. The plain String code lets you use familiar methods,  but it can introduce subtle bugs that are difficult to detect  at compile time. In this instance, we’ve used the wrong  index number to access the parent directory (/tmp). Using path::Path doesn’t make your code immune to  subtle errors, but it can certainly help to minimize their  likelihood. Path provides dedicated methods for com- mon operations such as setting a file’s extension.

Generally, this is the target’s OS but can be facilities provided by its CPU. Changing what is compiled depending on some compile-time condition is known as conditional compilation.  To add conditional compilation to your project, annotate your source code with cfg attributes. cfg works in conjunction with the target parameter provided to rustc during compilation.  Listing 7.8 provides a usage string common as quick documentation for command- line utilities for multiple operating systems. It’s replicated in the following listing, which uses conditional compilation to provide two definitions of const USAGE in the code. When the project is built for Windows, the usage string contains a .exe file extension. The resulting binary files include only the data that is relevant for their target.  3 #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]  4 const USAGE: &str = \"  5 Usage:  6     akv_mem.exe FILE get KEY Listing 7.9 Demonstrating the use of conditional compilation'},\n",

The responsi- bilities of the ActionKV struct are to manage interactions with the filesystem and to encode and decode data from the on-disk format. Figure 7.2 depicts the relationships. 7.7.1 Initializing the ActionKV struct Listing 7.10, an excerpt from listing 7.8, shows the initial- ization process of libactionkv::ActionKV. To create an instance of libactionkv::ActionKV, we need to do the following: 1 Point to the file where the data is stored 2 Load an in-memory index from the data within the file 30 let mut store = ActionKV::open(path) 31                .expect(\"unable to open file\");    32  33 store.load().expect(\"unable to load data\");     Both steps return Result, which is why the calls to .expect() are also present. Let’s now look inside the code of ActionKV::open() and ActionKV::load(). open() opens the file from disk, and load() loads the offsets of any pre-existing data into an in- memory index. The code uses two type aliases, ByteStr and ByteString: type ByteStr = [u8]; target_vendor apple, pc, unknown test No available options; just uses a  simple Boolean check. debug_assertions No available options; just uses a  simple Boolean check. This attri- bute is present for non-optimized  builds and supports the  debug_assert! macro.

Both str and [u8] (or its alias ByteStr) are seen in the wild as &str and &[u8] (or &ByteStr).

It is an implementa- tion of the Bitcask storage backend that was developed for the original implementa- tion of the Riak database. Bitcask belongs to a family of file formats known in the literature as Log-Structured Hash Tables. What is EOF? File operations in Rust might return an error of type std::io::ErrorKind:: UnexpectedEof, but what is Eof? The end of file (EOF) is a convention that operating systems provide to applications. There is no special marker or delimiter at the end of a file within the file itself. EOF is a zero byte (0u8). When reading from a file, the OS tells the application how many bytes were successfully read from storage. If no bytes were successfully read from disk, yet no error condition was detected, then the OS and, therefore, the appli- cation assume that EOF has been reached. This works because the OS has the responsibility for interacting with physical devices. When a file is read by an application, the application notifies the OS that it would like to access the disk.  What is Riak? Riak, a NoSQL database, was developed during the height of the NoSQL movement and competed against similar systems such as MongoDB, Apache CouchDB, and Tokyo Tyrant. It distinguished itself with its emphasis on resilience to failure. Although it was slower than its peers, it guaranteed that it never lost data. That guar- antee was enabled in part because of its smart choice of a data format. Unexpected is relative. The  application might not have  expected to encounter the  end of the file, but we expect  files to be finite, so we’ll deal  with that eventuality.'},\n",

Every key-value pair is prefixed by 12 bytes. Those bytes describe its length (key_len + val_len) and its content (checksum).  The process_record() function does the processing for this within ActionKV. It begins by reading 12 bytes that represent three integers: a checksum, the length of the key, and the length of the value. Those values are then used to read the rest of the data from disk and verify what’s intended. The following listing, an extract from list- ing 7.16, shows the code for this process. 43 fn process_record<R: Read>( 44   f: &mut R                     45 ) -> io::Result<KeyValuePair> { 46     let saved_checksum =                 47       f.read_u32::<LittleEndian>()?;     48     let key_len =                        49       f.read_u32::<LittleEndian>()?;     50     let val_len =                        51       f.read_u32::<LittleEndian>()?;       52     let data_len = key_len + val_len; 53  54     let mut data = ByteString::with_capacity(data_len as usize); 55  56     { 57       f.by_ref()                 58         .take(data_len as u64) 59         .read_to_end(&mut data)?; 60     } Listing 7.12 Focusing on the ActionKV::process_record() method Fixed-width header checksum key_len value_len Variable-width key Variable-width value key value u32 [u8; key_len] [u8; value_len] u32 u32 Role Layout Data type Variable name Specifying an array’s type with a variable is not legal Rust but is added here to demonstrate the relationship between the header and the body of each record.

This sounds easy, but computing platforms differ as to how numbers are read. Some read the 4 bytes of an i32 from left to right; others read from right to left. That could potentially be a problem if the program is designed to be writ- ten by one computer and loaded by another.  The Rust ecosystem provides some support here. The byteorder crate can extend types that implement the standard library’s std::io::Read and std::io::Write traits. std::io::Read and std::io::Write are commonly associated with std::io::File but are also implemented by other types such as [u8] and TcpStream. The exten- sions can guarantee how multi-byte sequences are interpreted, either as little endian or big endian.  To follow what’s going on with our key-value store, it will help to have an under- standing of how byteorder works. Listing 7.14 is a toy application that demonstrates the core functionality. Lines 11–23 show how to write to a file and lines 28–35 show how to read from one. The two key lines are use byteorder::{LittleEndian}; use byteorder::{ReadBytesExt, WriteBytesExt}; byteorder::LittleEndian and its peers BigEndian and NativeEndian (not used in listing 7.14) are types that declare how multi-byte data is written to and read from disk. byteorder::ReadBytesExt and byteorder::WriteBytesExt are traits. In some sense, these are invisible within the code.  These extend methods to primitive types such as f32 and i16 without further cere- mony. Bringing those into scope with a use statement immediately adds powers to the types that are implemented within the source of byteorder (in practice, that means primitive types). Rust, as a statically-typed language, makes this transformation at debug_assert! tests  are disabled in  optimized builds,  enabling debug  builds to have more  runtime checks. A checksum (a number) verifies that the bytes read from disk are the  same as what was intended. This process is discussed in section 7.7.4.

What if something is interrupted during the original write? We may not be able to recover the original data if this is the case, but if we could recognize the issue, then we would be in a position to alert the user.  A well-worn path to overcome this problem is to use a technique called a checksum. Here’s how it works: \\uf0a1Saving to disk—Before data is written to disk, a checking function (there are many options as to which function) is applied to those bytes. The result of the checking function (the checksum) is written alongside the original data. No checksum is calculated for the bytes of the checksum. If something breaks while writing the checksum’s own bytes to disk, this will be noticed later as an error. \\uf0a1Reading from disk—Read the data and the saved checksum, applying the check- ing function to the data. Then compare the results of the two checking func- tions. If the two results do not match, an error has occurred, and the data should be considered corrupted. Which checking function should you use? Like many things in computer science, it depends. An ideal checksum function would \\uf0a1Return the same result for the same input \\uf0a1Always return a different result for different inputs \\uf0a1Be fast \\uf0a1Be easy to implement'},\n",

To summarize \\uf0a1The parity bit is easy and fast, but it is somewhat prone to error. \\uf0a1CRC32 (cyclic redundancy check returning 32 bits) is much more complex, but its results are more trustworthy. \\uf0a1Cryptographic hash functions are more complex still. Although being signifi- cantly slower, they provide high levels of assurance. Functions that you might see in the wild depend on your application domain. More traditional areas might see the use of simpler systems, such as a parity bit or CRC32. IMPLEMENTING PARITY BIT CHECKING This section describes one of the simpler checksum schemes: parity checking. Parity checks count the number of 1s within a bitstream. These store a bit that indicates whether the count was even or odd.  Parity bits are traditionally used for error detection within noisy communication systems, such as transmitting data over analog systems such as radio waves. For exam- ple, the ASCII encoding of text has a particular property that makes it quite conve- nient for this scheme. Its 128 characters only require 7 bits of storage (128 = 27). That leaves 1 spare bit in every byte.  Systems can also include parity bits in larger streams of bytes. Listing 7.15 presents an (overly chatty) implementation. The parity_bit() function in lines 1–10 takes an arbitrary stream of bytes and returns a u8, indicating whether the count of the input’s bits was even or odd. When executed, listing 7.15 produces the following output: input: [97, 98, 99]             97 (0b01100001) has 3 one bits 98 (0b01100010) has 3 one bits 99 (0b01100011) has 4 one bits output: 00000001 input: [97, 98, 99, 100]        97 (0b01100001) has 3 one bits 98 (0b01100010) has 3 one bits 99 (0b01100011) has 4 one bits 100 (0b01100100) has 3 one bits result: 00000000 NOTE The code for the following listing is in ch7/ch7-paritybit/src/main.rs.

Because we’re using an append-only design, this means that the last two operations can be implemented as variants of insert.  You may have noticed that during load(), the inner loop continues until the end of the file. This allows more recent updates to overwrite stale data, including dele- tions. Inserting a new record is almost the inverse of process_record(), described in section 7.7.2. For example 164 pub fn insert( 165   &mut self, 166   key: &ByteStr, 167   value: &ByteStr 168 ) -> io::Result<()> { 169   let position = self.insert_but_ignore_index(key, value)?; 170  171   self.index.insert(key.to_vec(), position);     172   Ok(()) 173 } 174  175 pub fn insert_but_ignore_index( 176   &mut self, 177   key: &ByteStr, 178   value: &ByteStr 179 ) -> io::Result<u64> { 180   let mut f = BufWriter::new(&mut self.f);     181  Listing 7.15 Implementing parity bit checking Takes a byte slice as the bytes  argument and returns a single  byte as output. This function could  have easily returned a bool value,  but returning u8 allows the result  to bit shift into some future  desired position. All of Rust’s integer types come equipped with  count_ones() and count_zeros() methods. There are plenty of methods to optimize this  function. One fairly simple approach is to hard  code a const [u8; 256] array of 0s and 1s,  corresponding to the intended result, then  index that array with each byte.  key.to_vec() converts the  &ByteStr to a ByteString. The std::io::BufWriter type batches  multiple short write() calls into  fewer actual disk operations,  resulting in a single one. This  increases throughput while keeping  the application code neater.'},\n",

Rust uses the terms HashMap and BTreeMap to define two implementations of the same abstract data type. Rust is closest to C++ and Java in this regard. In this book, the terms collection of key-value pairs and associative array refer to the abstract data type. Hash table refers to associative arrays implemented with a hash table, and a HashMap refers to Rust’s implementation of hash tables. What is a hash? What is hashing? If you’ve ever been confused by the term hash, it may help to understand that this relates to an implementation decision made to enable non-integer keys to map to val- ues. Hopefully, the following definitions will clarify the term: \\uf0a1A HashMap is implemented with a hash function. Computer scientists will under- stand that this implies a certain behavior pattern in common cases. A hash map has a constant time lookup in general, formally denoted as O(1) in big O notation. (Although a hash map’s performance can suffer when its underlying hash function encounters some pathological cases as we’ll see shortly.) \\uf0a1A hash function maps between values of variable-length to fixed-length. In prac- tice, the return value of a hash function is an integer. That fixed-width value can then be used to build an efficient lookup table. This internal lookup table is known as a hash table. The following example shows a basic hash function for &str that simply interprets the first character of a string as an unsigned integer. It, therefore, uses the first char- acter of the string as an hash value: fn basic_hash(key: &str) -> u32 {     let first = key.chars()                           .next()                        .unwrap_or('\\\\0');         unsafe {                                              std::mem::transmute::<char, u32>(first)       }                                             } The .chars() iterator converts  the string into a series of char  values, each 4 bytes long. Returns an Option that’s  either Some(char) or None  for empty strings If an empty string, provides NULL as the default.  unwrap_or() behaves as unwrap() but provides a value  rather than panicking when it encounters None. Interprets the memory  of first as an u32, even  though its type is char\"},\n",

It uses some Polynesian island nations and their capital cities to show the use of an associative array. {   \"Cook Islands\": \"Avarua\",   \"Fiji\": \"Suva\",   \"Kiribati\": \"South Tarawa\",   \"Niue\": \"Alofi\",   \"Tonga\": \"Nuku\\'alofa\",   \"Tuvalu\": \"Funafuti\" } Rust does not provide a literal syntax for HashMap within the standard library. To insert items and get them out again, follow the example provided in listing 7.18, whose source is available in ch7/ch7-pacific-basic/src/main.rs. When executed, listing 7.18 produces the following line in the console: Capital of Tonga is: Nuku\\'alofa  1 use std::collections::HashMap;  2   3 fn main() { basic_hash can take any string as input—an infinite set of possible inputs—and return a fixed-width result for all of those in a deterministic manner. That’s great! But, although basic_hash is fast, it has some significant faults. If multiple inputs start with the same character (for example, Tonga and Tuvalu), these result in the same output. This happens in every instance when an infinite input space is mapped into a finite space, but it’s particularly bad here. Natural language text is not uniformly distributed. Hash tables, including Rust’s HashMap, deal with this phenomenon, which is called a hash collision. These provide a backup location for keys with the same hash value. That secondary storage is typically a Vec<T> that we’ll call the collision store. When collisions occur, the collision store is scanned from front to back when it is accessed. That linear scan takes longer and longer to run as the store’s size increases. Attack- ers can make use of this characteristic to overload the computer that is performing the hash function. In general terms, faster hash functions do less work to avoid being attacked. These will also perform best when their inputs are within a defined range. Fully understanding the internals of how hash tables are implemented is too much detail for this sidebar. But it’s a fascinating topic for programmers who want to extract optimum performance and memory usage from their programs.

With some support from the wider Rust ecosystem, it’s possible to inject JSON string literals into Rust code. It’s best that the conversion is done at compile time, meaning no loss of runtime performance. The output of listing 7.19 is also a single line: Capital of Tonga is: \"Nuku\\'alofa\"    The next listing uses a serde-json crate to include JSON literals within your Rust source code. Its source code is in the ch7/ch7-pacific-json/src/main.rs file.  1 #[macro_use]                  2 extern crate serde_json;      3   4 fn main() {  5   let capitals = json!({         6     \"Cook Islands\": \"Avarua\",  7     \"Fiji\": \"Suva\",  8     \"Kiribati\": \"South Tarawa\",  9     \"Niue\": \"Alofi\", 10     \"Tonga\": \"Nuku\\'alofa\", 11     \"Tuvalu\": \"Funafuti\" 12   }); 13  14   println!(\"Capital of Tonga is: {}\", capitals[\"Tonga\"]) 15 } 7.7.9 Retrieving values from HashMap and BTreeMap The main advantage that a key-value store provides is the ability to access its values. There are two ways to achieve this. To demonstrate, let’s assume that we have initial- ized capitals from listing 7.19. The approach (already demonstrated) is to access val- ues via square brackets: capitals[\"Tonga\"]    Listing 7.19 Including JSON literals with serde-json Type declarations of keys and  values are not required here  as these are inferred by the  Rust compiler. HashMap implements Index,  which allows for values to  be retrieved via the square  bracket indexing style. Uses double quotes because the json!  macro returns a wrapper around  String, its default representation Incorporates the serde_json crate  and makes use of its macros, bringing  the json! macro into scope json! takes a JSON literal and some  Rust expressions to implement String  values. It converts these into a Rust  value of type serde_json::Value, an  enum that can represent every type  within the JSON specification.  Returns \"Nuku’alofa\"'},\n",

       "  'text': '245 Understanding the core of actionkv:  The libactionkv crate This approach returns a read-only reference to the value, which is deceptive when dealing with examples containing string literals because their status as references is somewhat disguised. In the syntax used by Rust’s documentation, this is described as &V, where & denotes a read-only reference and V is the type of the value. If the key is not present, the program will panic. NOTE Index notation is supported by all types that implement the Index trait. Accessing capitals[\"Tonga\"] is syntactic sugar for capitals.index(\"Tonga\"). It’s also possible to use the .get() method on HashMap. This returns an Option<&V>, providing the opportunity to recover from cases where values are missing. For example capitals.get(\"Tonga\")     Other important operations supported by HashMap include \\uf0a1Deleting key-value pairs with the .remove() method \\uf0a1Iterating over keys, values, and key-value pairs with the .keys(), .values(), and .iter() methods, respectively, as well as their read-write variants, .keys_mut(), .values_mut(), and .iter_mut() There is no method for iterating through a subset of the data. For that, we need to use BTreeMap.  7.7.10 How to decide between HashMap and BTreeMap If you’re wondering about which backing data structure to choose, here is a simple guideline: use HashMap unless you have a good reason to use BTreeMap. BTreeMap is faster when there is a natural ordering between the keys, and your application makes use of that arrangement. Table 7.9 highlights the differences.  Let’s demonstrate these two use cases with a small example from Europe. The Dutch East India Company, known as VOC after the initials of its Dutch name, Ver- eenigde Oostindische Compagnie, was an extremely powerful economic and political force at its peak. For two centuries, VOC was a dominant trader between Asia and Europe. It had its own navy and currency, and established its own colonies (called trading posts). It was also the first company to issue bonds. In the beginning, investors from six business chambers (kamers) provided capital for the business.  Let’s use these investments as key-value pairs. When listing 7.20 is compiled, it pro- duces an executable that generates the following output: $ cargo run -q  Rotterdam invested 173000 Hoorn invested 266868 Delft invested 469400 Enkhuizen invested 540000 Middelburg invested 1300405 Amsterdam invested 3697915 smaller chambers: Rotterdam Hoorn Delft Returns Some(\"Nuku’alofa\")'},\n",

There is a large design space involved with storage and retrieval systems, which is why new ones are always being developed. Common to all of those systems, however, is a component that is the real smarts behind the database.  Built in section 7.5.2, actionkv v1 contains a major issue that prevents it from hav- ing a decent startup time. Every time it’s run, it needs to rebuild its index of where keys are stored. Let’s add the ability for actionkv to store its own data that indexes within the same file that’s used to store its application data. It will be easier than it sounds. No changes to libactionkv are necessary. And the front-end code only requires minor additions. The project folder now has a new structure with an extra file (shown in the following listing).

Most readers of this book will have encountered web programming. Most web programming involves interacting with some sort of framework. Let’s look there.  HTTP is the protocol that web frameworks understand. Learning more about HTTP enables us to extract the most performance out of our web frameworks. It can also help us to more easily diagnose any problems that occur. Figure 8.2 shows net- working protocols for content delivery over the internet.  Networking is comprised of layers.

Each layer relies upon the layers below it. Occassionally layers bleed together. For example, HTML ﬁles can include directives that overwrite those provided by HTTP. For a message to be received, each layer must be traversed from bottom to top. To send messages, the steps are reversed. HOW TO READ Vertical positioning typically indicates that two levels interact at that location. Exceptions include encryption provided by TLS. Network addressing provided by either IPv4 or IPv6, and virtual layers are largely ignorant of physical links. (Shadows from physics do appear on upper layers in the form of latency and reliability.) Gaps indicate that a higher level can pass directly through to the lower level. A domain name or TLS security is not necessary for HTTP to function, for example.

Lower levels receive a stream of bytes and pass it on. Higher levels don’t care how messages are sent; they just want them sent.  Let’s consider one example: HTTP. HTTP is known as an application-level protocol. Its job is to transport content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebAssembly modules, images, video, and other formats. These formats often include other embedded for- mats via compression and encoding standards. HTTP itself often redundantly includes information provided by one of the layers below it, TCP. Between HTTP and TCP sits TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security), which has replaced SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), adds the S to HTTPS.  TLS provides encrypted messaging over an unencrypted connection. TLS is imple- mented on top of TCP. TCP sits upon many other protocols. These go all the way down to specifying how voltages should be interpreted as 0s and 1s. And yet, as complicated as this story is so far, it gets worse. These layers, as you have probably seen in your dealings with those as a computer user, bleed together like watercolor paint.  HTML includes a mechanism to supplement or overwrite directives omitted or specified within HTTP: the <meta> tag’s http-equiv attribute. HTTP can make adjust- ments downwards to TCP. The “Connection: keep-alive” HTTP header instructs TCP to maintain its connection after this HTTP message has been received. These sorts of interactions occur all through the stack. Figure 8.2 provides one view of the network- ing stack. It is more complicated than most attempts. And even that complicated pic- ture is highly simplified.  Despite all of that, we’re going to try to implement as many layers as possible within a single chapter. By the end of it, you will be sending HTTP requests with a vir- tual networking device and a minimal TCP implementation that you created yourself, using a DNS resolver that you also created yourself.  8.2 Generating an HTTP GET request with reqwest Our first implementation will be with a high-level library that is focused on HTTP. We’ll use the reqwest library because its focus is primarily on making it easy for Rust programmers to create an HTTP request.  Although it’s the shortest, the reqwest implementation is the most feature-complete. As well as being able to correctly interpret HTTP headers, it also handles cases like content redirects. Most importantly, it understands how to handle TLS properly.  In addition to expanded networking capabilities, reqwest also validates the con- tent’s encoding and ensures that it is sent to your application as a valid String. None of our lower-level implementations do any of that. The following shows the project structure for listing 8.2: ch8-simple/ ├── src │  └── main.rs └── Cargo.toml'},\n",

The response variable holds a struct representing the server’s response. The response .text() method returns a Result that provides access to the HTTP body after validat- ing that the contents are a legal String.  One question, though: What on earth is the error side of the Result return type Box<dyn std::error::Error>? This is an example of a trait object that enables Rust to support polymorphism at runtime. Trait objects are proxies for concrete types. The syn- tax Box<dyn std::error::Error> means a Box (a pointer) to any type that imple- ments std::error:Error’s.  Using a library that knows about HTTP allows our programs to omit many details. For example \\uf0a1Knowing when to close the connection. HTTP has rules for telling each of the parties when the connection ends. This isn’t available to us when manually making requests. Instead, we keep the connection open for as long as possible and hope that the server will close.

You will also develop the world’s next best-selling fantasy role-playing game—the rpg project. If you would like to focus on networking, feel free to skip ahead to section 8.4.  There is a reasonable amount of jargon in the next several paragraphs. Brace your- self. You’ll do fine. Let’s start by introducing trait objects by what they achieve and what they do, rather than focusing on what they are. 8.3.1 What do trait objects enable? While trait objects have several uses, they are immediately helpful by allowing you to create containers of multiple types. Although players of our role-playing game can choose different races, and each race is defined in its own struct, you’ll want to treat those as a single type. A Vec<T> won’t work here because we can’t easily have types T, U, and V wedged into Vec<T> without introducing some type of wrapper object.  8.3.2 What is a trait object? Trait objects add a form of polymorphism—the ability to share an interface between types—to Rust via dynamic dispatch. Trait objects are similar to generic objects. Gener- ics offer polymorphism via static dispatch. Choosing between generics and type objects typically involves a trade off between disk space and time: \\uf0a1Generics use more disk space with faster runtimes. \\uf0a1Trait objects use less disk space but incur a small runtime overhead caused by pointer indirection. Trait objects are dynamically-sized types, which means that these are always seen in the wild behind a pointer. Trait objects appear in three forms: &dyn Trait, &mut dyn Trait, and Box<dyn Trait>.1 The primary difference between the three forms is that Box<dyn Trait> is an owned trait object, whereas the other two are borrowed.  1 In old Rust code, you may see &Trait, and Box<Trait>. While legal syntax, these are officially deprecated. Adding dyn keyword is strongly encouraged.'},\n",

Characters in the game can be one of three races: humans, elves, and dwarves. These are represented by the Human, Elf, and Dwarf structs, respectively.  Characters interact with things. Things are represented by the Thing type.2 Thing is an enum that currently represents swords and trinkets. There’s only one form of interaction right now: enchantment. Enchanting a thing involves calling the enchant() method: character.enchant(&mut thing) When enchantment is successful, thing glows brightly. When a mistake occurs, thing is transformed into a trinket. Within listing 8.4, we create a party of characters with the following syntax: 58 let d = Dwarf {}; 59 let e = Elf {}; 60 let h = Human {}; 61  62 let party: Vec<&dyn Enchanter> = vec![&d, &h, &e];     Casting the spell involves choosing a spellcaster. We make use of the rand crate for that: 58 let spellcaster = party.choose(&mut rand::thread_rng()).unwrap(); 59 spellcaster.enchant(&mut it) The choose() method originates from the rand::seq::SliceRandom trait that is brought into scope in listing 8.4.

In a sense, they provide a way to navigate Rust’s rigid type system. As you learn about this feature in more detail, you will encounter some jargon. For example, trait objects are a form of type erasure. The compiler does not have access to the original type during the call to enchant(). Trait vs. type One of the frustrating things about Rust’s syntax for beginners is that trait objects and type parameters look similar. But types and traits are used in different places. For example, consider these two lines: use rand::Rng; use rand::rngs::ThreadRng; Although these both have something to do with random number generators, they’re quite different. rand::Rng is a trait; rand::rngs::ThreadRng is a struct. Trait objects make this distinction harder. When used as a function argument and in similar places, the form &dyn Rng is a ref- erence to something that implements the Rng trait, whereas &ThreadRng is a refer- ence to a value of ThreadRng. With time, the distinction between traits and types becomes easier to grasp. Here’s some common use cases for trait objects: Dwarves are poor  spellcasters, and their  spells regularly fail. Spells cast by  elves rarely fail. Humans are proficient  at enchanting things.  Mistakes are  uncommon. We can hold members of dif- ferent types within the same Vec as all these implement the Enchanter trait.'},\n",

Trait objects enable functions to return multiple concrete types. \\uf0a1Supporting dynamic dispatch, whereby the function that is called is deter- mined at runtime rather than at compile time. Before the Rust 2018 edition, the situation was even more confusing. The dyn key- word did not exist. This meant that context was needed to decide between &Rng and &ThreadRng. Trait objects are not objects in the sense that an object-oriented programmer would understand. They’re perhaps closer to a mixin class. Trait objects don’t exist on their own; they are agents of some other type. An alternative analogy would be a singleton object that is delegated with some author- ity by another concrete type. In listing 8.4, the &Enchanter is delegated to act on behalf of three concrete types.  Listing 8.5 Project metadata for listing 8.6'},\n",

Using this version of HTTP ensures that the connection is closed when the server sends its response. HTTP 1.0, however, does not support “keep alive” requests. Specifying HTTP 1.1 actually confuses this code as the server will refuse to close the connection until it has received another request, and the client will never send one. \\uf0a1On line 13, we include the hostname. This may feel redundant given that we used that exact hostname when we connected on lines 7–8. However, one should remembers that the connection is established over IP, which does not have host names. When TcpStream::connect() connects to the server, it only uses an IP address. Adding the Host HTTP header allows us to inject that infor- mation back into the context. 8.4.1 What is a port number? Port numbers are purely virtual. They are simply u16 values. Port numbers allow a sin- gle IP address to host multiple services.  8.4.2 Converting a hostname to an IP address So far, we’ve provided the hostname www.rustinaction.com to Rust. But to send mes- sages over the internet, the IP (internet protocol) address is required. TCP knows nothing about domain names. To convert a domain name to an IP address, we rely on the Domain Name System (DNS) and its process called domain name resolution. Listing 8.6 Constructing an HTTP GET request Explicitly specifying the  port (80) is required.  TcpStream does not know  that this will become a  HTTP request. In many networking  protocols, \\\\r\\\\n signifies  a new line. Two blank new  lines signify end  of request std::io::copy()  streams bytes  from a Reader  to a Writer.'},\n",

DNS requests can be made over TCP, including encryption with TLS, but are also sent over UDP (User Datagram Protocol). We’ll use DNS here because it’s more use- ful for learning purposes.  To explain how the translation from a domain name to an IP address works, we’ll create a small application that does the translation. We’ll call the application resolve. You’ll find its source code in listing 8.9. The application makes use of public DNS ser- vices, but you can easily add your own with the -s argument. Our resolve application only understands a small portion of DNS protocol, but that portion is sufficient for our purposes. The project makes use of an external crate, trust-dns, to perform the hard work. The trust-dns crate implements RFC 1035, which defines DNS and several later RFCs quite faithfully using terminology derived from it. Table 8.1 outlines some of the terms that are useful to understand. Public DNS providers At the time of writing, several companies provide DNS servers for public use.

Listing 8.7, an excerpt from listing 8.9, shows the process of constructing a message that asks, “Dear DNS server, what is the IPv4 address for domain_name?” The listing constructs the DNS message, whereas the trust-dns crate requests an IPv4 address for domain_name. 35 let mut msg = Message::new();    36 msg 37   .set_id(rand::random::<u16>())       38   .set_message_type(MessageType::Query) 39   .add_query(                              40       Query::query(domain_name, RecordType::A)     41   ) 42   .set_op_code(OpCode::Query) 43   .set_recursion_desired(true);    We’re now in a position where we can meaningfully inspect the code. It has the follow- ing structure: \\uf0a1Parses command-line arguments \\uf0a1Builds a DNS message using trust_dns types \\uf0a1Converts the structured data into a stream of bytes \\uf0a1Sends those bytes across the wire After that, we need to accept the response from the server, decode the incoming bytes, and print the result. Error handling remains relatively ugly, with many calls to unwrap() and expect(). We’ll address that problem shortly in section 8.5. The end process is a command-line application that’s quite simple. Opcode An OpCode enum is, in some  sense, a subtype of Message- Type. This is an extensibility  mechanism that allows future  functionality. For example, RFC  1035 defines the Query and  Status opcodes but others were  defined later. The Notify and  Update opcodes are defined by  RFC 1996 and RFC 2136, respec- tively.

The underlying array looks the same, but the difference in length is significant. Within the call to recv_from() at line 58, the trust-dns crate includes a check that response_as_bytes has sufficient space. That check uses the length field, which results in a crash. Knowing how to wriggle around with initialization can be handy for satisfying an APIs’ expectations. It’s time to recap. Our overall task in this section was to make HTTP requests. HTTP is built on TCP. Because we only had a domain name (www.rustinaction.com) when we made the request, we needed to use DNS. DNS is primarily delivered over UDP, so we needed to take a diversion and learn about UDP.  Now it’s almost time to return to TCP. Before we’re able to do that, though, we need to learn how to combine error types that emerge from multiple dependencies.  8.5 Ergonomic error handling for libraries Rust’s error handling is safe and sophisticated. However, it offers a few challenges. When a function incorporates Result types from two upstream crates, the ? opera- tor no longer works because it only understands a single type. This proves to be important when we refactor our domain resolution code to work alongside our TCP code. This section discusses some of those challenges as well as strategies for manag- ing them. How DNS supports connections within UDP UDP does not have a notion of long-lived connections. Unlike TCP, all messages are short-lived and one-way. Put another way, UDP does not support two-way (duplex) communications. But DNS requires a response to be sent from the DNS server back to the client. To enable two-way communications within UDP, both parties must act as clients and servers, depending on context. That context is defined by the protocol built on top of UDP. Within DNS, the client becomes a DNS server to receive the server’s reply. The following table provides a flow chart of the process. Stage DNS client role DNS server role Request sent from DNS client UDP client UDP server Reply sent from DNS server UDP server UDP client'},\n",

But things become more complicated when we want to work with multiple error types. TIP For single files, compile the code with rustc <filename> rather than using cargo build. For example, if a file is named io-error.rs, then the shell command is rustc io-error.rs && ./io-error[.exe]. To start, let’s look at a small example that covers the easy case of a single error type. We’ll try to open a file that does not exist. When run, listing 8.10 prints a short mes- sage in Rust syntax: $ rustc ch8/misc/io-error.rs && ./io-error  Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" } We won’t win any awards for user experience here, but we get a chance to learn a new language feature. The following listing provides the code that produces a single error type. You’ll find its source in ch8/misc/io-error.rs. 1 use std::fs::File; 2  3 fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> { 4     let _f = File::open(\"invisible.txt\")?; 5  6     Ok(()) 7 } Now, let’s introduce another error type into main(). The next listing produces a com- piler error, but we’ll work through some options to get the code to compile. The code for this listing is in ch8/misc/multierror.rs.  1 use std::fs::File;  2 use std::net::Ipv6Addr;  3   4 fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {  5   let _f = File::open(\"invisible.txt\")?;     6   7   let _localhost = \"::1\"      8     .parse::<Ipv6Addr>()?;    9  10   Ok(()) 11 } To compile listing 8.11, enter the ch8/misc directory and use rustc.

The error message can be difficult to interpret if you don’t know what the question mark operator (?) is doing. Why are there multiple messages about std::con- vert::From? Well, the ? operator is syntactic sugar for the try! macro. try! performs two functions: \\uf0a1When it detects Ok(value), the expression evaluates to value. \\uf0a1When Err(err) occurs, try!/? returns early after attempting to convert err to the error type defined in the calling function. In Rust-like pseudocode, the try! macro could be defined as macro try {   match expression {     Result::Ok(val) => val,         Result::Err(err) => {       let converted = convert::From::from(err);             return Result::Err(converted);         }   }); } Looking at listing 8.11 again, we can see the try! macro in action as ?:  4 fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {  5   let _f = File::open(\"invisible.txt\")?;      6   7   let _localhost = \"::1\"       8     .parse::<Ipv6Addr>()?;    Uses val when an  expression matches  Result::Ok(val) Converts err to the  outer function’s error  type when it matches  Result::Err(err) and  then returns early Returns from the  calling function, not  the try! macro itself File::open() returns  std::io::Error, so no  conversion is necessary. \"\".parse() presents ? with a std::net::AddrParseError.

Because the signature of main is main() ? Result<(), std::io ::Error>, Rust attempts to convert the std::net::AddrParseError produced by parse::<Ipv6Addr>() into a std::io::Error. Don’t worry, though; we can fix this! Earlier, in section 8.3, we introduced trait objects. Now we’ll be able to put those to good use.  Using Box<dyn Error> as the error variant in the main() function allows us to prog- ress. The dyn keyword is short for dynamic, implying that there is a runtime cost for this flexibility. Running listing 8.12 produces this output: $ rustc ch8/misc/traiterror.rs && ./traiterror Error: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: \"No such file or directory\" } I suppose it’s a limited form of progress, but progress nonetheless. We’ve circled back to the error we started with. But we’ve passed through the compiler error, which is what we wanted.  Going forward, let’s look at listing 8.12. It implements a trait object in a return value to simplify error handling when errors originate from multiple upstream crates. You can find the source for this listing in ch8/misc/traiterror.rs.  1 use std::fs::File;  2 use std::error::Error;  3 use std::net::Ipv6Addr;  4   5 fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {       6   7   let _f = File::open(\"invisible.txt\")?;     8   9   let _localhost = \"::1\" 10     .parse::<Ipv6Addr>()?    11  12   Ok(()) 13 } Wrapping trait objects in Box is necessary because their size (in bytes on the stack) is unknown at compile time. In the case of listing 8.12, the trait object might originate from either File::open() or \"::1\".parse(). What actually happens depends on the circumstances encountered at runtime. A Box has a known size on the stack. Its raison d’être is to point to things that don’t, such as trait objects.

Multiple error types in one function prevent returning Result. The first strategy we looked at was to use trait objects, but trait objects have a potentially significant downside.  Using trait objects is also known as type erasure. Rust is no longer aware that an error has originated upstream. Using Box<dyn Error> as the error variant of a Result means that the upstream error types are, in a sense, lost. The original errors are now converted to exactly the same type.  It is possible to retain the upstream errors, but this requires more work on our behalf. We need to bundle upstream errors in our own type. When the upstream errors are needed later (say, for reporting errors to the user), it’s possible to extract these with pattern matching. Here is the process: 1 Define an enum that includes the upstream errors as variants. 2 Annotate the enum with #[derive(Debug)]. 3 Implement Display. 4 Implement Error, which almost comes for free because we have implemented Debug and Display. 5 Use map_err() in your code to convert the upstream error to your omnibus error type. NOTE You haven’t previously encountered the map_err() function. We’ll explain what it does when we get there later in this section. It’s possible to stop with the previous steps, but there’s an optional extra step that improves the ergonomics. We need to implement std::convert::From to remove the need to call map_err(). To begin, let’s start back with listing 8.11, where we know that the code fails: use std::fs::File; use std::net::Ipv6Addr; fn main() -> Result<(), std::io::Error> {   let _f = File::open(\"invisible.txt\")?;   let _localhost = \"::1\"     .parse::<Ipv6Addr>()?;   Ok(()) } This code fails because \"\".parse::<Ipv6Addr>() does not return a std::io::Error.

In Rust, an enum works well. Listing 8.13 does not compile, but does do this step. We’ll tidy up the imports slightly, though: use std::io; use std::net; enum UpstreamError{   IO(io::Error),   Parsing(net::AddrParseError), } ANNOTATE THE ENUM WITH #[DERIVE(DEBUG)] The next change is easy. It’s a single-line change—the best kind of change. To anno- tate the enum, we’ll add #[derive(Debug)], as the following shows: use std::io; use std::net; #[derive(Debug)] enum UpstreamError{   IO(io::Error),   Parsing(net::AddrParseError), } IMPLEMENT STD::FMT::DISPLAY We’ll cheat slightly and implement Display by simply using Debug. We know that this is available to us because errors must define Debug.

To end up with the kind of code that we’d like to write, let’s make the following change: use std::error;     use std::fmt; use std::io; use std::net; #[derive(Debug)] enum UpstreamError{   IO(io::Error),   Parsing(net::AddrParseError), } impl fmt::Display for UpstreamError {   fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter<\\'_>) -> fmt::Result {     write!(f, \"{:?}\", self)   } } impl error::Error for UpstreamError { }     The impl block is—well, we can rely on default implementations provided by the com- piler—especially terse. Because there are default implementations of every method defined by std::error::Error, we can ask the compiler to do all of the work for us.  USE MAP_ERR() The next fix is to add map_err() to our code to convert the upstream error to the omni- bus error type. Back at listing 8.13, we wanted to have a main() that looks like this: fn main() -> Result<(), UpstreamError> {   let _f = File::open(\"invisible.txt\")?     .maybe_convert_to(UpstreamError);   let _localhost = \"::1\"     .parse::<Ipv6Addr>()?

Here’s how. The map_err() function maps an error to a func- tion. (Variants of our UpstreamError enum can be used as functions here.) Note that the ? operator needs to be at the end. Otherwise, the function can return before the code has a chance to convert the error.  Listing 8.14 provides the new code.

But to enable that, we need to implement From.  IMPLEMENT STD::CONVERT::FROM TO REMOVE THE NEED TO CALL MAP_ERR() The std::convert::From trait has a single required method, from(). We need two impl blocks to enable our two upstream error types to be convertible. The following snippet shows how: impl From<io::Error> for UpstreamError {   fn from(error: io::Error) -> Self {     UpstreamError::IO(error)   } } impl From<net::AddrParseError> for UpstreamError {   fn from(error: net::AddrParseError) -> Self {     UpstreamError::Parsing(error)   } } Now the main() function returns to a simple form of itself: fn main() -> Result<(), UpstreamError> {   let _f = File::open(\"invisible.txt\")?;   let _localhost = \"::1\".parse::<Ipv6Addr>()?;   Ok(()) } The full code listing is provided in listing 8.15. Implementing From places the burden of extra syntax on the library writer. It results in a much easier experience when using your crate, simplifying its use by downstream programmers.

Every hardware device also includes a unique identifier that’s inde- pendent of the network it’s connected to. Why a second number? The answer is par- tially technical and partially historical.  Ethernet networking and the internet started life independently. Ethernet’s focus was on local area networks (LANs). The internet was developed to enable communica- tion between networks, and Ethernet is the addressing system understood by devices that share a physical link (or a radio link in the case of WiFi, Bluetooth, and other wireless technologies).  Perhaps a better way to express this is that MAC (short for media access control ) addresses are used by devices that share electrons (figure 8.3). But there are a few differences: \\uf0a1IP addresses are hierarchical, but MAC addresses are not. Addresses appearing close together numerically are not close together physically, or organizationally. \\uf0a1MAC addresses are 48 bits (6 bytes) wide. IP addresses are 32 bits (4 bytes) wide for IPv4 and 128 bits (16 bytes) for IPv6. There are two forms of MAC addresses: \\uf0a1Universally administered (or universal) addresses are set when devices are manufactured. Manufacturers use a prefix assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority and a scheme of their choosing for the remaining bits. \\uf0a1Locally administered (or local) addresses allow devices to create their own MAC addresses without registration. When setting a device’s MAC address yourself in software, you should make sure that your address is set to the local form. First byte transmitted Local/universal ﬂag Unicast/multicast ﬂag Device Local addresses Universal addresses Organization Device Flags Common ﬁelds In Rust syntax, the layout of a MAC address is speciﬁed as [u8; 6].

       "  'text': '279 MAC addresses MAC addresses have two modes: unicast and multicast. The transmission behavior for these forms is identical. The distinction is made when a device makes a decision about whether to accept a frame. A frame is a term used by the Ethernet protocol for a byte slice at this level. Analogies to frame include a packet, wrapper, and envelope. Figure 8.4 shows this distinction. Unicast addresses are intended to transport information between two points that are in direct contact (say, between a laptop and a router). Wireless access points complicate matters somewhat but don’t change the fundamentals. A multicast address can be accepted by multiple recipients, whereas unicast has a single recipient. The term unicast is somewhat misleading, though. Sending an Ethernet packet involves more than two devices. Using a unicast address alters what devices do when they receive packets but not which data is transmitted over the wire (or through the radio waves). 8.6.1 Generating MAC addresses When we begin talking about raw TCP in section 8.8, we’ll create a virtual hardware device in listing 8.22. To convince anything to talk to us, we need to learn how to assign our virtual device a MAC address. The macgen project in listing 8.17 generates Unicast vs. multicast MAC addresses >_ Sender includes destination MAC address in a frame. Router broadcasts the destination MAC address to all devices listening on the port included in the frame. Single device accepts the frame. Other devices ignore the frame. Although there are three outbound arrows from the wireless access point, there is only a single RF transmission. Unicast Multicast Multiple devices may accept the frame. Transmission behavior is consistent in both modes. Receiving behavior is mode-speciﬁc. Unicast/multicast is set in the least-signiﬁcant bit of the ﬁrst transmitted byte in a MAC address. What determines the mode? When set to , the MAC 1 address is multicast. Figure 8.4 The differences between multicast and unicast MAC addresses'},\n",

Line 25 contains some relatively obscure syntax, though. octets[0] |= 0b_0000_0011 coerces the two flag bits described at figure 8.3 to a state of 1. That designates every MAC address we generate as locally assigned and unicast.  8.7 Implementing state machines with Rust’s enums Another prerequisite for handling network messages is being able to define a state machine. Our code needs to adapt to changes in connectivity.  Listing 8.22 contains a state machine, implemented with a loop, a match, and a Rust enum. Because of Rust’s expression-based nature, control flow operators also return values. Every time around the loop, the state is mutated in place. The following listing shows the pseudocode for how a repeated match on a enum works together. enum HttpState {     Connect,     Request,     Response, } loop {     state = match state {         HttpState::Connect if !socket.is_active() => {             socket.connect();             HttpState::Request         }         HttpState::Request if socket.may_send() => {             socket.send(data);             HttpState::Response         }         HttpState::Response if socket.can_recv() => {             received = socket.recv();             HttpState::Response         }         HttpState::Response if !socket.may_recv() => {             break;         } Listing 8.18 Pseudocode for a state machine implementation'},\n",

We’ll make use of it in listing 8.22. Making use of an enum embeds the state machine’s transitions into the type system itself.  But we’re still at a level that is far too high! To dig deeper, we’re going to need to get some assistance from the OS.  8.8 Raw TCP Integrating with the raw TCP packets typically requires root/superuser access. The OS starts to get quite grumpy when an unauthorized user asks to make raw network requests. We can get around this (on Linux) by creating a proxy device that non-super users are allowed to communicate with directly. 8.9 Creating a virtual networking device To proceed with this section, you will need to create virtual networking hardware. Using virtual hardware provides more control to freely assign IP and MAC addresses. It also avoids changing your hardware settings, which could affect its ability to connect to the network. To create a TAP device called tap-rust, execute the following com- mand in your Linux console: $ sudo \\\\       >  ip tuntap \\\\      >    add \\\\        >    mode tap \\\\    >    name tap-rust \\\\    >    user $USER      Don’t have Linux? If you’re running another OS, there are many virtualization options available. Here are a few: \\uf0a1The Multipass project (https://multipass.run/) provides fast Ubuntu virtual machines on macOS and Windows hosts. \\uf0a1WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ windows/wsl/about), is another option to look into. \\uf0a1Oracle VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an open source project with excellent support for many host operating systems.  Executes as the root user Tells ip that we’re  managing TUN/ TAP devices Uses the add  subcommand Uses the TUN tunnelling mode Gives your device  a unique name Grants access to your non-root user account'},\n",

       "  'text': '283 “Raw” HTTP When successful, ip prints no output. To confirm that our tap-rust device was added, we can use the ip tuntap list subcommand as in the following snippet. When exe- cuted, you should see the tap-rust device in the list of devices in the output: $ ip tuntap list  tap-rust: tap persist user Now that we have created a networking device, we also need to allocate an IP address for it and tell our system to forward packets to it. The following shows the commands to enable this functionality: $ sudo ip link set tap-rust up      $ sudo ip addr add 192.168.42.100/24 dev tap-rust     $ sudo iptables \\\\           >   -t nat\\\\                 >   -A POSTROUTING \\\\        >   -s 192.168.42.0/24 \\\\    >   -j MASQUERADE           $ sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1     The following shows how to remove the device (once you have completed this chap- ter) by using del rather than add: $ sudo ip tuntap del mode tap name tap-rust 8.10 “Raw” HTTP We should now have all the knowledge we need to take on the challenge of using HTTP at the TCP level. The mget project (mget is short for manually get ) spans list- ings 8.20–8.23. It is a large project, but you’ll find it immensely satisfying to under- stand and build. Each file provides a different role: \\uf0a1main.rs (listing 8.20)—Handles command-line parsing and weaves together the functionality provided by its peer files. This is where we combine the error types using the process outlined in section 8.5.2. \\uf0a1ethernet.rs (listing 8.21)—Generates a MAC address using the logic from listing 8.17 and converts between MAC address types (defined by the smoltcp crate) and our own. \\uf0a1http.rs (listing 8.22)—Carries out the work of interacting with the server to make the HTTP request. \\uf0a1dns.rs (listing 8.23)—Performs DNS resolution, which converts a domain name to an IP address.

Hopefully it’s revealed several interesting avenues for you to explore. Perhaps, surprisingly, there are several more networking layers to unwrap. Well done for making your way through a lengthy and challenging chapter.  Summary \\uf0a1Networking is complicated. Standard models such as OSIs are only partially accurate. \\uf0a1Trait objects allow for runtime polymorphism. Typically, programmers prefer generics because trait objects incur a small runtime cost. However, this situation is not always clear-cut. Using trait objects can reduce space because only a single version of each function needs to be compiled. Fewer functions also benefits cache coherence. \\uf0a1Networking protocols are particular about which bytes are used. In general, you should prefer using &[u8] literals (b\"…\") over &str literals (\"...\") to ensure that you retain full control. \\uf0a1There are three main strategies for handling multiple upstream error types within a single scope: – Create an internal wrapper type and implement From for each of the upstream types – Change the return type to make use of a trait object that implements std:: error:Error – Use .unwrap() and its cousin .expect() \\uf0a1Finite state machines can be elegantly modeled in Rust with an enum and a loop. At each iteration, indicate the next state by returning the appropriate enum variant. \\uf0a1To enable two-way communications in UDP, each side of the conversation must be able to act as a client and a server.'},\n",

It’s a fully func- tioning client that can be included in your own computer’s boot process to keep it in sync with the world.  Understanding how time works within computers supports your efforts to build resilient applications. The system clock jumps both backwards and forwards in time. Knowing why this happens allows you to anticipate and prepare for that eventuality.  Your computer also contains multiple physical and virtual clocks. It takes some knowledge to understand the limitations of each and when these are appropriate. Understanding the limitations of each should foster a healthy skepticism about micro benchmarks and other time-sensitive code.  Some of the hardest software engineering involves distributed systems that need to agree on what the time is.

       "  'text': '294 CHAPTER 9 Time and timekeeping you’re able to maintain a network atomic clock that provides a worldwide time syn- chronization of 7 ms. The closest open source alternative is CockroachDB (https:// www.cockroachlabs.com/). It relies on the NTP, which can have a (worldwide) latency of approximately dozens of milliseconds. But that doesn’t make it useless. When deployed within a local network, NTP allows computers to agree on the time to within a few milliseconds or less.  On the Rust side of the equation, this chapter invests lots of time interacting with the OS internals. You’ll become more confident with unsafe blocks and with using raw pointers. Readers will become familiar with chrono, the de facto standard crate for high-level time and clock operations. 9.1 Background It’s easy to think that a day has 86,400 seconds (60 s × 60 min × 24 h = 86,400 s). But the earth’s rotation isn’t quite that perfect. The length of each day fluctuates due to tidal friction with the moon and other effects such as torque at the boundary of the earth’s core and its mantle.  Software does not tolerate these imperfections. Most systems assume that most sec- onds have an equal duration. The mismatch presents several problems.  In 2012, a large number of services—including high profile sites such as Reddit and Mozilla’s Hadoop infrastructure—stopped functioning after a leap second was added to their clocks. And, at times, clocks can go back in time (this chapter does not, however, cover time travel). Few software systems are prepared for the same time- stamp to appear twice. That makes it difficult to debug the logs. There are two options for resolving this impasse: \\uf0a1Keep the length of each second fixed. This is good for computers but irritating for humans. Over time, “midday” drifts towards sunset or sunrise. \\uf0a1Adjust the length of each year to keep the sun’s position relative to noon in the same place from year to year. This is good for humans but sometimes highly irritating for computers. In practice, we can chose both options as we do in this chapter. The world’s atomic clocks use their own time zone with fixed-length seconds, called TAI. Everything else uses time zones that are periodically adjusted; these are called UTC.  TAI is used by the world’s atomic clocks and maintains a fixed-length year. UTC adds leap seconds to TAI about once every 18 months. In 1972, TAI and UTC were 10 seconds apart. By 2016, they had drifted to 36 seconds apart.  In addition to the issues with earth’s fickle rotational speed, the physics of your own computer make it challenging to keep accurate time. There are also (at least) two clocks running on your system. One is a battery-powered device, called the real-time clock. The other one is known as system time. System time increments itself based on hardware interrupts provided by the computer’s motherboard. Somewhere in your system, a quartz crystal is oscillating rapidly.'},\n",

When the computer turns on, the system clock is set to epoch time. That it, it is set to the number of elapsed seconds since 1 Jan 1970. During boot, it uses the NTP to identify the current time. What about situations where there is no network connection? This is the situation faced by the Cacophony Project (https://cacophony.org.nz/), which develops devices to support New Zealand’s native bird species by applying computer vision to accu- rately identify pest species. The main sensor of the device is a thermal imaging camera. Footage needs to be annotated with accurate timestamps. To enable this, the Cacophony Project team decided to add an additional real-time clock, Raspberry Pi Hat, to their custom board.

       "  'text': '296 CHAPTER 9 Time and timekeeping 9.2 Sources of time Computers can’t look at the clock on the wall to determine what time it is. They need to figure it out by themselves. To explain how this happens, let’s consider how digital clocks operate generally, then how computer systems operate given some difficult con- straints, such as operating without power.  Digital clocks consist of two main parts. The first part is some component that ticks at regular intervals. The second part is a pair of counters. One counter increments as ticks occur. The other increments as seconds occur. Determining “now” within digital clocks means comparing the number of seconds against some predetermined starting point. The starting point is known as the epoch.  Embedded hardware aside, when your computer is turned off, a small battery- powered clock continues to run. Its electric charge causes a quartz crystal to oscillate rapidly. The clock measures those oscillations and updates its internal counters. In a running computer, the CPU clock frequency becomes the source of regular ticks. A CPU core operates at a fixed frequency.1 Inside the hardware, a counter can be accessed via CPU instructions and/or by accessing predefined CPU registers.2  Relying on a CPU’s clock can actually cause problems in niche scientific and other high-accuracy domains, such as profiling an application’s behavior. When computers use multiple CPUs, which is especially common in high performance computing, each CPU has a slightly different clock rate. Moreover, CPUs perform out-of-order execution. This means that it’s impossible for someone creating a benchmarking/ profiling software suite to know how long a function takes between two timestamps. The CPU instructions requesting the current timestamp may have shifted.  9.3 Definitions Unfortunately, this chapter needs to introduce some jargon: \\uf0a1Absolute time—Describes the time that you would tell someone if they were to ask for the time. Also referred to as wall clock time and calendar time. \\uf0a1Real-time clock—A physical clock that’s embedded in the computer’s motherboard, which keeps time when the power is off. It’s also known as the CMOS clock. \\uf0a1System clock—The operating system’s view of the time. Upon boot, the OS takes over timekeeping duties from the real-time clock. All applications derive their idea of time from the system time. The system clock experiences jumps, as it can be manually set to a different position. This jumpiness can confuse some applications. \\uf0a1Monotonically increasing—A clock that never provides the same time twice. This is a useful property for a computer application because, among other advantages, 1 Dynamic adjustments to a CPU’s clock speed do occur in many processors to conserve power, but these hap- pen infrequently enough from the point of view of the clock as to be insignificant. 2 For example, Intel-based processors support the RDTSC instruction, which stands for Read Time Stamp Counter.'},\n",

       "  'text': '297 Encoding time log messages will never have a repeated timestamp. Unfortunately, preventing time adjustments means being permanently bound to the local clock’s skew. Note that the system clock is not monotonically increasing. \\uf0a1Steady clock—This clock provides two guarantees: its seconds are all equal length and it is monotonically increasing. Values from steady clocks are unlikely to align with the system clock’s time or absolute time. These typically start at 0 when computers boot up, then count upwards as an internal counter progresses. Although potentially useless for knowing the absolute time, these are handy for calculating the duration between two points in time. \\uf0a1High accuracy—A clock is highly accurate if the length of its seconds are regular. The difference between two clocks is known as skew. Highly accurate clocks have little skew against the atomic clocks that are humanity’s best engineering effort at keeping accurate time. \\uf0a1High resolution—Provides accuracy down to 10 nanoseconds or below. High res- olution clocks are typically implemented within CPU chips because there are few devices that can maintain time at such high frequency. CPUs are able to do this. Their units of work are measured in cycles, and cycles have the same dura- tion. A 1 GHz CPU core takes 1 nanosecond to compute one cycle. \\uf0a1Fast clock—A clock that takes little time to read the time. Fast clocks sacrifice accuracy and precision for speed, however.  9.4 Encoding time There are many ways to represent time within a computer. The typical approach is to use a pair of 32-bit integers. The first counts the number of seconds that have elapsed. The second represents a fraction of a second. The precision of the fractional part depends on the device in question.  The starting point is arbitrary. The most common epoch in UNIX-based systems is 1 Jan 1970 UTC. Alternatives include 1 Jan 1900 (which happens to be used by NTP), 1 Jan 2000 for more recent applications, and 1 Jan 1601 (which is the begin- ning of the Gregorian calendar). Using fixed-width integers presents two key advan- tages and two main challenges: \\uf0a1Advantages include – Simplicity—It’s easy to understand the format. – Efficiency—Integer arithmetic is the CPU’s favorite activity. \\uf0a1Disadvantages include – Fixed-range—All fixed-integer types are finite, implying that time eventually wraps around to 0 again. – Imprecise—Integers are discrete, while time is continuous. Different systems make different trade-offs relating to subsecond accuracy, leading to round- ing errors.'},\n",

       "  'text': '298 CHAPTER 9 Time and timekeeping It’s also important to note that the general approach is inconsistently implemented. Here are some things seen in the wild to represent the seconds component: \\uf0a1UNIX timestamps, a 32-bit integer, represents milliseconds since epoch (e.g., 1 Jan 1970). \\uf0a1MS Windows FILETIME structures (since Windows 2000), a 64-bit unsigned integer, represents 100 nanosecond increments since 1 Jan 1601 (UTC). \\uf0a1Rust community’s chronos crate, a 32-bit signed integer, implements NaiveTime alongside an enum to represent time zones where appropriate.3 \\uf0a1 time_t (meaning time type but also called simple time or calendar time) within the C standard library (libc) varies: – Dinkumware’s libc provides an unsigned long int (e.g., a 32-bit unsigned integer). – GNU’s libc includes a long int (e.g., a 32-bit signed integer). – AVR’s libc uses a 32-bit unsigned integer, and its epoch begins at midnight, 1 January 2000 (UTC). Fractional parts tend to use the same type as their whole-second counterparts, but this isn’t guaranteed. Now, let’s take a peek a time zones. 9.4.1 Representing time zones Time zones are political divisions, rather than technical ones. A soft consensus appears to have been formed around storing another integer that represents the number of seconds offset from UTC.  9.5 clock v0.1.0: Teaching an application how  to tell the time To begin coding our NTP client, let’s start by learning how to read time. Figure 9.1 provides a quick overview of how an application does that. 3 chronos has relatively few quirks, but one of which is sneaking leap seconds into the nanoseconds field.

Within the application, we’ll first make a small cosmetic change. Rather than using functions to read the time and adjust it, we’ll use static methods of a Clock struct. The following listing, an excerpt from listing 9.7, shows the change from listing 9.2.  2 use chrono::{DateTime};  3 use chrono::{Local};  4   5 struct Clock;  6   7 impl Clock {  8     fn get() -> DateTime<Local> {     9         Local::now() 10     } 11  12     fn set() -> ! { 13         unimplemented!() 14     } 15 } What on earth is the return type of set()? The exclamation mark (!) indicates to the compiler that the function never returns (a return value is impossible). It’s referred to as the Never type. If the unimplemented!() macro (or its shorter cousin todo!()) is reached at runtime, then the program panics.  Clock is purely acting as a namespace at this stage. Adding a struct now provides some extensibility later on. As the application grows, it might become useful for Clock to contain some state between calls or implement some trait to support new functionality. NOTE A struct with no fields is known as a zero-sized type or ZST. It does not occupy any memory in the resulting application and is purely a compile-time construct.

The following listing, an excerpt from listing 9.7, demonstrates how to produce timestamps using the func- tionality provided by chrono. The timestamps are then sent to stdout. 48     let now = Clock::get(); 49     match std { 50         \"timestamp\" => println!(\"{}\", now.timestamp()), 51         \"rfc2822\"   => println!(\"{}\", now.to_rfc2822()), 52         \"rfc3339\"   => println!(\"{}\", now.to_rfc3339()), 53         _ => unreachable!(), 54     } Our clock application (thanks to chrono) supports three time formats—timestamp, rfc2822, and rfc3339: \\uf0a1timestamp—Formats the number of seconds since the epoch, also known as a UNIX timestamp. \\uf0a1rfc2822—Corresponds to RPC 2822 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822), which is how time is formatted within email message headers. \\uf0a1rfc3339—Corresponds to RFC 3339 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). RFC 3339 formats time in a way that is more commonly associated with the ISO 8601 standard. However, ISO 8601 is a slightly stricter standard. Every RFC 3339- compliant timestamp is an ISO 8601-compliant timestamp, but the inverse is not true.  9.6.3 Providing a full command-line interface Command-line arguments are part of the environment provided to an application from its OS when it’s established. These are raw strings. Rust provides some support for accessing the raw Vec<String> via std::env::args, but it can be tedious to develop lots of parsing logic for moderately-sized applications.  Our code wants to be able to validate certain input, such that the desired output format is one that the clock app actually supports. But validating input tends to be irri- tatingly complex. To avoid this frustration, clock makes use of the clap crate.  There are two main types that are useful for getting started: clap::App and clap::Arg. Each clap::Arg represents a command-line argument and the options that it can represent. clap::App collects these into a single application. To support the public API in table 9.1, the code in listing 9.5 uses three Arg structs that are wrapped together within a single App.  Listing 9.5 is an excerpt from listing 9.7. It demonstrates how to implement the API presented in table 9.1 using clap. Listing 9.4 Showing the methods used to format timestamps'},\n",

       "  'text': '306 CHAPTER 9 Time and timekeeping 9.7.1 Common behavior Listing 9.11 provides two implementations of setting the time. These both follow a common pattern: 1 Parsing a command-line argument to create a DateTime<FixedOffset> value. The FixedOffset time zone is provided by chrono as a proxy for “whichever time zone is provided by the user.” chrono doesn’t know at compile time which time zone will be selected. 2 Converting the DateTime<FixedOffset> to a DateTime<Local> to enable time zone comparisons. 3 Instantiating an OS-specific struct that’s used as an argument for the necessary system call (system calls are function calls provided by the OS). 4 Setting the system’s time within an unsafe block. This block is required because responsibility is delegated to the OS. 5 Printing the updated time. WARNING This code uses functions to teleport the system’s clock to a differ- ent time. This jumpiness can cause system instability. Some applications expect monotonically increasing time. A smarter (but more com- plex) approach is to adjust the length of a second for n seconds until the desired time is reached. Functionality is implemented within the Clock struct that was introduced in section 9.6.1.  9.7.2 Setting the time for operating systems that use libc POSIX-compliant operating systems can have their time set via a call to settimeof- day(), which is provided by libc. libc is the C Standard Library and has lots of historic connections with UNIX operating systems. The C language, in fact, was developed to write UNIX. Even today, interacting with a UNIX derivative involves using the tools pro- vided by the C language. There are two mental hurdles required for Rust programmers to understanding the code in listing 9.11, which we’ll address in the following sections: \\uf0a1The arcane types provided by libc \\uf0a1The unfamiliarity of providing arguments as pointers LIBC TYPE NAMING CONVENTIONS libc uses conventions for naming types that differ from Rust’s. libc does not use Pascal- Case to denote a type, preferring to use lowercase. That is, where Rust would use TimeVal, libc uses timeval. The convention changes slightly when dealing with type aliases. Within libc, type aliases append an underscore followed by the letter t (_t) to the type’s name. The next two snippets show some libc imports and the equivalent Rust code for building those types.  On line 64 of listing 9.8, you will encounter this line: libc::{timeval, time_t, suseconds_t};'},\n",

In Rust syntax, these are defined like this: #![allow(non_camel_case_types)] type time_t = i64; type suseconds_t = i64; pub struct timeval {     pub tv_sec: time_t,     pub tv_usec: suseconds_t, } time_t represents the seconds that have elapsed since the epoch. suseconds_t rep- resents the fractional component of the current second.  The types and functions relating to timekeeping involve a lot of indirection. The code is intended to be easy to implement, which means providing local implementors (hard- ware designers) the opportunity to change aspects as their platforms require. The way this is done is to use type aliases everywhere, rather than sticking to a defined integer type.  NON-WINDOWS CLOCK CODE The libc library provides a handy function, settimeofday, which we’ll use in listing 9.8. The project’s Cargo.toml file requires two extra lines to bring libc bindings into the crate for non-Windows platforms: [target.\\'cfg(not(windows))\\'.dependencies]     libc = \"0.2\" The following listing, an extract from listing 9.11, shows how to set the time with C’s standard library, libc. In the listing, we use Linux and BSD operating systems or other similar ones. 62 #[cfg(not(windows))] 63 fn set<Tz: TimeZone>(t: DateTime<Tz>) -> () {          64   use libc::{timeval, time_t, suseconds_t};     65   use libc::{settimeofday, timezone }           66  67   let t = t.with_timezone(&Local); 68   let mut u: timeval = unsafe { zeroed() }; 69  70   u.tv_sec = t.timestamp() as time_t; 71   u.tv_usec = 72     t.timestamp_subsec_micros() as suseconds_t; 73  74   unsafe { 75     let mock_tz: *const timezone = std::ptr::null();   76     settimeofday(&u as *const timeval, mock_tz); 77   } 78 } Listing 9.8 Setting the time in a libc environment You can add these two lines  to the end of the file. t is sourced from the command line and has already been parsed. The timezone parameter of  settimeofday() appears to  be some sort of historic  accident. Non-null values  generate an error.'},\n",

This code cheekily, and probably perilously, avoids checking whether the settime- ofday function is successful. It’s quite possible that it isn’t. That will be remedied in the next iteration of the clock application.  9.7.3 Setting the time on MS Windows The code for MS Windows is similar to its libc peers. It is somewhat wordier, as the struct that sets the time has more fields than the second and subsecond part. The rough equivalent of the libc library is called kernel32.dll, which is accessible after including the winapi crate. WINDOWS API INTEGER TYPES Windows provides its own take on what to call integral types. This code only makes use of the WORD type, but it can be useful to remember the two other common types that have emerged since computers have used 16-bit CPUs. The following table shows how integer types from kernel32.dll correspond to Rust types. REPRESENTING TIME IN WINDOWS Windows provides multiple time types. Within our clock application, however, we’re mostly interested in SYSTEMTIME. Another type that is provided is FILETIME. The fol- lowing table describes these types to avoid confusion. Windows type Rust type Remarks WORD u16 Refers to the width of a CPU “word” as it was when Windows was  initially created DWORD u32 Double word QWORD u64 Quadruple word LARGE_INTEGER i64 A type defined as a crutch to enable 32-bit and 64-bit platforms to  share code ULARGE_INTEGER u64 An unsigned version of LARGE_INTEGER  Windows type Rust type Remarks SYSTEMTIME winapi::SYSTEMTIME Contains fields for the year, month, day of the week, day  of the month, hour, minute, second, and millisecond. FILETIME winapi::FILETIME Analogous to libc::timeval. Contains second and  millisecond fields.

Among other things, it doesn’t check to see whether the calls to settimeofday() and SetSystemTime() were actually successful.  There are multiple reasons why setting the time might fail. The most obvious one is that the user who is attempting to set the time lacks permission to do so. The robust approach is to have Clock::set(t) return Result. As that requires modifying two functions that we have already spent some time explaining in depth, let’s introduce a workaround that instead makes use of the operating system’s error reporting: fn main() {   // ...   if action == \"set\" {     // ...     Clock::set(t);     let maybe_error =       std::io::Error::last_os_error();        let os_error_code =       &maybe_error.raw_os_error();            match os_error_code {       Some(0) => (),                  Some(_) => eprintln!(\"Unable to set the time: {:?}\", maybe_error),       None => (),     }   } } After calls to Clock::set(t), Rust happily talks to the OS via std::io::Error::last _os_error(). Rust checks to see if an error code has been generated.  Deconstructs maybe_error, a Rust  type, to convert it into a raw i32  value that’s easy to match Matching on a raw integer saves  importing an enum, but sacrifices  type safety. Production-ready code  shouldn’t cheat in this way.'},\n",

There are multiple international standards for synchronizing clocks. This section focuses on the most prominent one—the Network Time Protocol (NTP).  NTP has existed since the mid-1980s, and it has proven to be very stable. Its on-wire format has not changed in the first four revisions of the protocol, with backwards com- patibility retained the entire time. NTP operates in two modes that can loosely be described as always on and request/response.  The always on mode allows multiple computers to work in a peer-to-peer fashion to converge on an agreed definition of now. It requires a software daemon or service to run constantly on each device, but it can achieve tight synchronization within local networks.  The request/response mode is much simpler. Local clients request the time via a single message and then parse the response, keeping track of the elapsed time. The client can then compare the original timestamp with the timestamp sent from the server, alter any delays caused by network latency, and make any necessary adjust- ments to move the local clock towards the server’s time.  Which server should your computer connect to? NTP works by establishing a hier- archy. At the center is a small network of atomic clocks. There are also national pools of servers.  NTP allows clients to request the time from computers that are closer to atomic clocks. But that only gets us part of the way. Let’s say that your computer asks 10 com- puters what they think the time is. Now we have 10 assertions about the time, and the network lag will differ for each source! 9.9.1 Sending NTP requests and interpreting responses Let’s consider a client-server situation where your computer wants to correct its own time. For every computer that you check with—let’s call these time servers—there are two messages: \\uf0a1The message from your computer to each time server is the request. \\uf0a1The reply is known as the response. These two messages generate four time points. Note that these occur in serial: \\uf0a1T1—The client’s timestamp for when the request was sent. Referred to as t1 in code. \\uf0a1T2—The time server’s timestamp for when the request was received. Referred to as t2 in code. \\uf0a1T3—The time server’s timestamp for when it sends its response. Referred to as t3 in code. \\uf0a1T4—The client’s timestamp for when the response was received. Referred to as t4 in code.'},\n",

The protocol contains more related to error handling, but that’s avoided here for simplicity. Otherwise, it’s a perfectly capable NTP client.  9.9.2 Adjusting the local time as a result of the server’s response Given that our client has received at least one (and hopefully a few more) NTP responses, all that’s left to do is to calculate the “right” time. But wait, which time is right? All we have are relative timestamps. There is still no universal “truth” that we’ve been given access to. NOTE For those readers who don’t enjoy Greek letters, feel free to skim or even skip the next few paragraphs. The NTP documentation provides two equations to help resolve the situation. Our aim is to calculate two values. Table 9.2 shows the calculations. \\uf0a1The time offset is what we’re ultimately interested in. It is denoted as \\uf071 (theta) by the official documentation. When \\uf071 is a positive number, our clock is fast. When it is negative, our clock is slow. \\uf0a1The delay caused by network congestion, latency, and other noise. This is denoted as \\uf064 (delta). A large \\uf064 implies that the reading is less reliable. Our code uses this value to follow servers that respond quickly. Sends a request payload (defined  elsewhere) to the server Blocks the application until  data is ready to be received rx_time() stands for received  timestamp and is the time  that the server received the  client’s message. tx_time() stands for  transmitted timestamp  and is the time that the  server sent the reply.'},\n",

That’s impossible to know. All we have are assertions.  NTP is designed to operate multiple times per day, with participants nudging their clocks incrementally over time. Given sufficient adjustments, \\uf071 tends to 0 while \\uf064 remains relatively stable.  The standard is quite prescriptive about the formula to carry out the adjustments. For example, the reference implementation of NTP includes some useful filtering to limit the effect of bad actors and other spurious results. But we’re going to cheat. We’ll just take a mean of the differences, weighted by 1 / \\uf0712. This aggressively penal- izes slow servers. To minimize the likelihood of any negative outcomes: \\uf0a1We’ll check the time with known “good” actors. In particular, we’ll use time servers hosted by major OS vendors and other reliable sources to minimize the chances of someone sending us a questionable result. \\uf0a1No single result will affect the result too much. We’ll provide a cap of 200 ms on any adjustments we make to the local time.

(T3 – T2)  calculates the total time spent on the server’s side. The distinction between the two differences (e.g., \\uf064), is an estimate of  the difference between the clocks, plus a delay caused by network traf- fic and processing. \\uf071 = ( (T2 – T1) + (T4 – T3) ) / 2 We take the average of the two pairs of timestamps. Listing 9.13 Adjusting the time according to the responses Google’s time servers implement leap seconds  by expanding the length of a second rather than  adding an extra second.

That’s roughly four times more precise! The different internal representations used imply that some accuracy is likely to be lost during conversions.  The From trait is the mechanism for telling Rust that two types can be converted. From provides the from() method, which is encountered early on in one’s Rust career (in examples such as String::from(\"Hello, world!\")).  The next listing, a combination of three extracts from listing 9.15, provides imple- mentations of the std::convert::From trait. This code enables the .into() calls on lines 28 and 34 of listing 9.13. 19 const NTP_TO_UNIX_SECONDS: i64 = 2_208_988_800;     Listing 9.14 Converting between chrono::DateTime and NTP timestamps Penalizes slow servers  by substantially  decreasing their  relative weights  Number of seconds between 1 Jan 1900 (the NTP epoch) and 1 Jan 1970 (the UNIX epoch)'},\n",

Implementing From allows Rust to automatically gen- erate an Into implementation on its own, except in advanced cases.

Instead, the book has used the single term: program. This chapter expands our vocabulary.  Processes, threads, and containers are abstractions created to enable multiple tasks to be carried out at the same time. This enables concurrency. Its peer term, par- allelism, means to make use of multiple physical CPU cores at the same time.  Counterintuitively, it is possible to have a concurrent system on a single CPU core. Because accessing data from memory and I/O take a long time, threads requesting data can be set to a blocked state. Blocked threads are rescheduled when their data is available.  Concurrency, or doing multiple things at the same time, is difficult to introduce into a computer program. Employing concurrency effectively involves both new concepts and new syntax.

You will have a solid understanding of the different tools that are available to you as an applications programmer. This chapter exposes you to the standard library and the well engineered crates crossbeam and rayon. It will enable you to use them, though it won’t give you sufficient background to be able to implement your own con- currency crates. The chapter follows the following structure: \\uf0a1It introduces you to Rust’s closure syntax in section 10.1. Closures are also known as anonymous functions and lambda functions. The syntax is important because the standard library and many (perhaps all) external crates rely on that syntax to provide support for Rust’s concurrency model. \\uf0a1It provides a quick lesson on spawning threads in section 10.2. You’ll learn what a thread is and how to create (spawn) those. You’ll also encounter a discussion of why programmers are warned against spawning tens of thousands of threads. \\uf0a1It distinguishes between functions and closures in section 10.3. Conflating these two concepts can be a source of confusion for programmers new to Rust as these are often indistinguishable in other languages. \\uf0a1It follows with a large project in section 10.4. You’ll implement a multithreaded parser and a code generator using multiple strategies. As a nice aside, you get to create procedural art along the way. \\uf0a1The chapter concludes with an overview of other forms of concurrency. This includes processes and containers. 10.1 Anonymous functions This chapter is fairly dense, so let’s get some points on the board quickly with some basic syntax and practical examples. We’ll circle back to fill in a lot of the conceptual and theoretical material.  Threads and other forms of code that can run concurrently use a form of function definition that we’ve avoided for the bulk of the book. Taking a look at it now, defin- ing a function looks like this: fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {   a + b } The (loosely) equivalent lambda function is let add = |a,b| { a + b }; Lambda functions are denoted by the pair of vertical bars (|…|) followed by curly brackets ({…}). The pair of vertical bars lets you define arguments. Lambda functions in Rust can read variables from within their scope. These are closures.  Unlike regular functions, lambda functions cannot be defined in global scope. The following listing gets around this by defining one within its main(). It defines two'},\n",

Let’s now see how to put this functionality to work.  10.2 Spawning threads Threads are the primary mechanism that operating systems provide for enabling con- current execution. Modern operating systems ensure that each thread has fair access to the CPU. Understanding how to create threads (often referred to as spawning treads) and understanding their impact are fundamental skills for programmers want- ing to make use of multi-core CPUs. 10.2.1 Introduction to closures To spawn a thread in Rust, we pass an anonymous function to std::thread::spawn(). As described in section 10.1, anonymous functions are defined with two vertical bars to provide arguments and then curly brackets for the function’s body. Because spawn() doesn’t take any arguments, you will typically encounter this syntax: thread::spawn(|| {     // ... }); When the spawned thread wants to access variables that are defined in the parent’s scope, called a capture, Rust often complains that captures must be moved into the clo- sure. To indicate that you want to move ownership, anonymous functions take a move keyword: thread::spawn(move || {        // ... }); Why is move required? Closures spawned in subthreads can potentially outlive their calling scope. As Rust will always ensure that accessing the data is valid, it requires Listing 10.1 Defining two functions and checking the result The move keyword allows the  anonymous function to access  variables from their wider scope.'},\n",

Here are some guidelines for using captures while you gain an understanding of how these work: \\uf0a1To reduce friction at compile time, implement Copy. \\uf0a1Values originating in outer scopes may need to have a static lifetime. \\uf0a1Spawned subthreads can outlive their parents. That implies that ownership should pass to the subthread with move.  10.2.2 Spawning a thread A simple task waits, sleeping the CPU for 300 ms (milliseconds). If you have a 3 GHz CPU, you’re getting it to rest for nearly 1 billion cycles. Those electrons will be very relieved. When executed, listing 10.2 prints the total duration (in “wall clock” time) of both executing threads. Here’s the output: 300.218594ms  1 use std::{thread, time};  2   3 fn main() {  4   let start = time::Instant::now();  5   6   let handler = thread::spawn(|| {  7     let pause = time::Duration::from_millis(300);  8     thread::sleep(pause.clone());  9   }); 10  11   handler.join().unwrap(); 12  13   let finish = time::Instant::now(); 14  15   println!(\"{:02?}\", finish.duration_since(start)); 16 } If you had encountered multi-threaded programming before, you would have been introduced to join on line 11. Using join is fairly common, but what does it mean?  join is an extension of the thread metaphor. When threads are spawned, these are said to have forked from their parent thread. To join threads means to weave these back together again.  In practice, join means wait for the other thread to finish. The join() function instructs the OS to defer scheduling the calling thread until the other thread finishes.  10.2.3 Effect of spawning a few threads In ideal settings, adding a second thread doubles the work we can do in the same amount of time. Each thread can gets its work done independently. Reality is not ideal, unfortunately. This has created a myth that threads are slow to create and bulky Listing 10.2 Sleeping a subthread for 300 ms'},\n",

Listing 10.3 shows a program that measures the overall time taken for two threads to perform the job that was carried out by a single thread in listing 10.2. If adding threads take a long time, we would expect the duration of listing 10.3’s code to be longer.  As you’ll notice, there is a negligible impact from creating one or two threads. As with listing 10.2, listing 10.3 prints almost the same output: 300.242328ms    The difference in these two runs on my computer was 0.24 ms. While by no means a robust benchmark suite, it does indicate that spawning a thread isn’t a tremendous performance hit.  1 use std::{thread, time};  2   3 fn main() {  4   let start = time::Instant::now();  5   6   let handler_1 = thread::spawn(move || {  7     let pause = time::Duration::from_millis(300);  8       thread::sleep(pause.clone());  9   }); 10  11   let handler_2 = thread::spawn(move || { 12     let pause = time::Duration::from_millis(300); 13       thread::sleep(pause.clone()); 14   }); 15  16   handler_1.join().unwrap(); 17   handler_2.join().unwrap(); 18  19   let finish = time::Instant::now(); 20  21   println!(\"{:?}\", finish.duration_since(start)); 22 } If you’ve had any exposure to the field before, you may have heard that threads “don’t scale.” What does that mean?  Every thread requires its own memory, and by implication, we’ll eventually exhaust our system’s memory. Before that terminal point, though, thread creation begins to trigger slowdowns in other areas. As the number of threads to schedule increases, the OS scheduler’s work increases. When there are many threads to schedule, deciding which thread to schedule next takes more time.

Figure 10.1 shows the data generated by successive runs of listing 10.4. The vari- ance stays quite tight until about 400 threads per batch. After that, there’s almost no knowing how long a 20 ms sleep will take. And, if you’re thinking that sleeping is not a representative workload, figure 10.2 shows the next plot, which is even more telling. It asks each thread to enter a spin loop.  Figure 10.2 provides features that are worth focusing in on briefly. First, for the first seven or so batches, the spin loop version returned closer to 20 ms. The operating system’s sleep functionality isn’t perfectly accurate, however. If you want to sleep pause a thread for short amounts of time, or if your application is sensitive to timing, use a spin loop.1  Second, CPU-intensive multithreading doesn’t scale well past the number of physi- cal cores. The benchmarking was performed on a 6-core CPU (the Intel i7-8750H) with hyper-threading disabled. Figure 10.3 shows that as soon as the thread count exceeds the core count, performance degrades quickly.  1 It’s also possible to use both: sleep for the bulk of the time and a spin loop towards the end. 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900 1000 Wall clock time for batch to return (ms) Threads spawned in batch Figure 10.1 Duration needed to wait for threads to sleep 20 ms'},\n",

A sleep is a request to the OS that the thread should be suspended until the time has passed.

Rather than iterating through the handlers vector, we call pop() and then drain it. The following two snip- pets compare the more familiar for loop (listing 10.6) with the control flow mecha- nism that is actually employed (listing 10.7). 19 for handle in &handlers { 20   handle.join(); 21 } 19 while let Some(handle) = handlers.pop() { 20   handle.join(); 21 } Why use the more complex control flow mechanism? It might help to remember that once we join a thread back to the main thread, it ceases to exist. Rust won’t allow us to retain a reference to something that doesn’t exist. Therefore, to call join() on a thread handler within handlers, the thread handler must be removed from handlers. That poses a problem. A for loop does not permit modifications to the data being iterated over. Instead, the while loop allows us to repeatedly gain mutable access when calling handlers.pop().  Listing 10.8 provides a broken implementation of the spin loop strategy. It is bro- ken because it uses the more familiar for loop control flow that was avoided in listing 10.5.

YIELDING CONTROL WITH THREAD::YIELD_NOW() As a reminder, the busy loop within listing 10.5 includes some unfamiliar code, repeated in the following listing. This section explains its significance. 14 while start.elapsed() < pause { 15   thread::yield_now(); 16 } std::thread::yield_now() is a signal to the OS that the current thread should be unscheduled. This allows other threads to proceed while the current thread is still waiting for the 20 ms to arrive. A downside to yielding is that we don’t know if we’ll be able to resume at exactly 20 ms.  An alternative to yielding is to use the function std::sync::atomic::spin_loop _hint(). spin_loop_hint() avoids the OS; instead, it directly signals the CPU. A CPU might use that hint to turn off functionality, thus saving power usage. NOTE The spin_loop_hint() instruction is not present for every CPU. On platforms that don’t support it, spin_loop_hint() does nothing.  10.2.6 Shared variables In our threading benchmarks, we created pause variables in each thread.

To learn more, run the command again with --verbose. The fix is to add the move keyword to where the closures are created, as hinted at in section 10.2.1. The following listing adds the move keyword, which switches the clo- sures to use move semantics.

Be sure to read the following section to learn those.  10.3 Differences between closures and functions There are some differences between closures (|| {}) and functions (fn). The differ- ences prevent closures and functions from being used interchangeably, which can cause problems for learners.  Closures and functions have different internal representations.

Those structs are invisible in source code but contain any vari- ables from the closure’s environment that are used inside it.  Functions are implemented as function pointers. A function pointer is a pointer that points to code, not data. Code, when used in this sense, is computer memory that has been marked as executable. To complicate matters, closures that do not enclose any variables from their environment are also function pointers. 10.4 Procedurally generated avatars from a multithreaded  parser and code generator This section applies the syntax that we learned in section 10.2 to an application. Let’s say that we want the users of our app to have unique pictorial avatars by default. One approach for doing this is to take their usernames and the digest of a hash function, and then use those digits as parameter inputs to some procedural generation logic. Using this approach, everyone will have visually similar yet completely distinctive default avatars.  Our application creates parallax lines. It does this by using the characters within the Base 16 alphabet as opcodes for a LOGO-like language. Forcing the compiler to reveal the type of closure The concrete type of a Rust closure is inaccessible as source code. The compiler cre- ates it. To retrieve it, force a compiler error like this: 1 fn main() { 2   let a = 20; 3  4   let add_to_a = |b| { a + b };     5   add_to_a == ();       6 } Among other errors, the compiler produces this one when attempting to compile the snippet as /tmp/a-plus-b.rs: $ rustc /tmp/a-plus-b.rs  error[E0369]: binary operation `==` cannot be applied to type `[closure@/tmp/a-plus-b.rs:4:20: 4:33]`  --> /tmp/a-plus-b.rs:6:14   | 6 |     add_to_a == ();   |     -------- ^^ -- ()   |     |   |     [closure@/tmp/a-plus-b.rs:4:20: 4:33] error: aborting due to previous error For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0369`.

To render SVG files, open the file in a web browser or a vector image program such as Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/).  10.4.2 Single-threaded render-hex overview The render-hex project converts its input to an SVG file. The SVG file format suc- cinctly describes drawings using mathematical operations. You can view the SVG file in any web browser and many graphics packages. Very little of the program relates to multithreading at this stage, so I’ll skip much of the details. The program has a simple pipeline comprised of four steps: 1 Receives input from STDIN 2 Parses the input into operations that describe the movement of a pen across a sheet of paper 3 Converts the movement operations into its SVG equivalent 4 Generates an SVG file Generates some input from  the Base 16 alphabet  (e.g., 0-9 and A-F) The project creates a  filename that matches  the input data.

       "  'text': \"344 CHAPTER 10 Processes, threads, and containers INPUT PARSING Our job in this section is to convert hexadecimal digits to instructions for a virtual pen that travels across a canvas. The Operation enum, shown in the following code snip- pet, represents these instructions. NOTE The term operation is used rather than instruction to avoid colliding with the terminology used within the SVG specification for path drawing. 21 #[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)] 22 enum Operation { 23     Forward(isize), 24     TurnLeft, 25     TurnRight, 26     Home, 27     Noop(usize), 28 } To parse this code, we need to treat every byte as an independent instruction. Numer- als are converted to distances, and letters change the orientation of the drawing: 123 fn parse(input: &str) -> Vec<Operation> { 124   let mut steps = Vec::<Operation>::new(); 125   for byte in input.bytes() { 126     let step = match byte { 127       b'0' => Home, 128       b'1'..=b'9' => { 129         let distance = (byte - 0x30) as isize;   130         Forward(distance * (HEIGHT/10)) 131       }, 132       b'a' | b'b' | b'c' => TurnLeft,     133       b'd' | b'e' | b'f' => TurnRight,    134       _ => Noop(byte),     135     } 136   }; 137     steps.push(step); 138   } 139   steps 140 } INTERPRET INSTRUCTIONS The Artist struct maintains the state of the diagram. Conceptually, the Artist is holding a pen at the coordinates x and y and is moving it in the direction of heading: 49 #[derive(Debug)] 50 struct Artist { 51   x: isize, 52   y: isize, 53   heading: Orientation, 54 } In ASCII, numerals start at  0x30 (48 in Base 10), so this  converts the u8 value of b'2' to  2. Performing this operation  on the whole range of u8  could cause a panic, but  we’re safe here, thanks to  the guarantee provided by  our pattern matching. There’s plenty of opportunity  to add more instructions to  produce more elaborate  diagrams without increasing  the parsing complexity. Although we don’t expect any illegal characters,  there may be some in the input stream. Using a  Noop operation allows us to decouple parsing  from producing output.\"},\n",

Its role is to convert the Vec<Operation> from parse() to a Vec<Command>. That output is used later to generate an SVG. As a nod to the LOGO language, Artist is given the local variable name turtle.

SVG documents look a lot like HTML documents, although the tags and attributes are different. The <path> tag is the most important one for our purposes. It has a d attribute (d is short for data) that describes how the path should be drawn. convert() produces a Vec<Command> that maps directly to the path data.

We’ll focus on one of these, the parse() function. To begin, adding parallelism is a two-step process: 1 Refactor code to use a functional style. 2 Use the rayon crate and its par_iter() method. USING A FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING STYLE The first step in adding parallelism is to replace our for. Rather than for, the toolkit for creating a Vec<T> with functional programming constructs includes the map() and collect() methods and higher-order functions, typically created with closures.  To compare the two styles, consider the differences to the parse() function from listing 10.18 (in ch10-render-hex/src/main.rs), repeated in the following listing, and a more functional style in listing 10.20 (in ch10-render-hex-functional/src/main.rs). 113 fn parse(input: &str) -> Vec<Operation> { 114   let mut steps = Vec::<Operation>::new(); 115   for byte in input.bytes() { 116     let step = match byte { 117       b\\'0\\' => Home, 118       b\\'1\\'..=b\\'9\\' => { 119         let distance = (byte - 0x30) as isize; 120         Forward(distance * (HEIGHT / 10)) 121       } 122       b\\'a\\' | b\\'b\\' | b\\'c\\' => TurnLeft, 123       b\\'d\\' | b\\'e\\' | b\\'f\\' => TurnRight, 124       _ => Noop(byte), 125     }; 126     steps.push(step); 127   } 128   steps 129 }   Listing 10.19 Implementing parse() with imperative programming constructs'},\n",

At a surface level, the primary change is that there is no longer a need to create the temporary variable steps. The partnership of map() and collect() removes the need for that: map() applies a function to every element of an iterator, and collect() stores the out- put of an iterator into a Vec<T>.  There is also a more fundamental change than eliminating temporary variables in this refactor, though. It has provided more opportunities for the Rust compiler to optimize your code’s execution.  In Rust, iterators are an efficient abstraction. Working with their methods directly allows the Rust compiler to create optimal code that takes up minimal memory. As an example, the map() method takes a closure and applies it to every element of the iter- ator. Rust’s trick is that map() also returns an iterator. This allows many transforma- tions to be chained together. Significantly, although map() may appear in multiple places in your source code, Rust often optimizes those function calls away in the compiled binary.  When every step that the program should take is specified, such as when your code uses for loops, you restrict the number of places where the compiler can make deci- sions. Iterators provide an opportunity for you to delegate more work to the compiler. This ability to delegate is what will shortly unlock parallelism.  USING A PARALLEL ITERATOR We’re going to cheat here and make use of a crate from the Rust community: rayon. rayon is explicitly designed to add data parallelism to your code. Data parallelism applies the same function (or closure!) on different data (such as a Vec<T>).  Assuming that you’ve already worked with the base render-hex project, add rayon to your crate’s dependencies with cargo by executing cargo add rayon@1: $ cargo add rayon@1        Updating 'https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index' index       Adding rayon v1 to dependencies Listing 10.20 Implementing parse() with functional programming constructs Run cargo install cargo-edit if the  cargo add command is unavailable.\"},\n",

But what should you do if you do not have an iterator? 10.4.4 Using a thread pool and task queue Sometimes, we don’t have a tidy iterator that we want to apply a function to. Another pattern to consider is the task queue. This allows tasks to originate anywhere and for the task processing code to be separated from task creation code. A fleet of worker threads can then pick tasks once these have finished their current one.

       "  'text': '354 CHAPTER 10 Processes, threads, and containers  There are many approaches to modeling a task queue. We could create a Vec<Task> and Vec<Result> and share references to these across threads. To prevent each thread from overwriting each other, we would need a data protection strategy.  The most common tool to protect data shared between threads is Arc<Mutex<T>>. Fully expanded, that’s your value T (e.g., Vec<Task> or Vec<Result> here) protected by a std::sync::Mutex, which itself is wrapped within std::sync::Arc. A Mutex is a mutually-exclusive lock. Mutually exclusive in this context means that no one has spe- cial rights. A lock held by any thread prevents all others. Awkwardly, a Mutex must itself be protected between threads. So we call in extra support. The Arc provides safe multithreaded access to the Mutex.  Mutex and Arc are not unified into a single type to provide programmers with added flexibility. Consider a struct with several fields. You may only need a Mutex on a single field, but you could put the Arc around the whole struct. This approach pro- vides faster read access to the fields that are not protected by the Mutex. A single Mutex retains maximum protection for the field that has read-write access. The lock approach, while workable, is cumbersome. Channels offer a simpler alternative.  Channels have two ends: sending and receiving. Programmers don’t get access to what is happening inside the channel. But placing data at the sending end means it’ll appear at the receiving end at some future stage. Channels can be used as a task queue because multiple items can be sent, even if a receiver is not ready to receive any messages.  Channels are fairly abstract. These hide their internal structure, preferring to dele- gate access to two helper objects. One can send(); the other can recv() (receive). Importantly, we don’t get access to how channels transmit any information sent through the channel. NOTE By convention, from radio and telegraph operators, the Sender is called tx (shorthand for transmission) and the Receiver is called rx. ONE-WAY COMMUNICATION This section uses the channels implementation from the crossbeam crate rather than from the std::sync::mpsc module within the Rust standard library. Both APIs pro- vide the same API, but crossbeam provides greater functionality and flexibility. We’ll spend a little time explaining how to use channels. If you would prefer to see them used as a task queue, feel free to skip ahead.  The standard library provides a channels implementation, but we’ll make use of the third-party crate, crossbeam. It provides slightly more features. For example, it includes both bounded queues and unbounded queues. A bounded queue applies back pres- sure under contention, preventing the consumer from becoming overloaded. Bounded queues (of fixed-width types) have deterministic maximum memory usage. These do have one negative characteristic, though. They force queue producers to wait until a space is available. This can make unbounded queues unsuitable for asynchronous messages, which cannot tolerate waiting.'},\n",

Within listing 10.24, the compiler infers the type parameter. tx is given the type Sender<i32> and rx is given the type Receiver<i32>. \\uf0a1The select! macro takes its name from other messaging systems like the POSIX sockets API. It allows the main thread to block and wait for a message. \\uf0a1Macros can define their own syntax rules. That is why the select! macro uses syntax (recv(rx) ->) that is not legal Rust.  WHAT CAN BE SENT THROUGH A CHANNEL? Mentally, you might be thinking of a channel like you would envision a network proto- col. Over the wire, however, you only have the type [u8] available to you. That byte stream needs to be parsed and validated before its contents can be interpreted.  Channels are richer than simply streaming bytes ([u8]). A byte stream is opaque and requires parsing to have structure extracted out of it. Channels offer you the full power of Rust’s type system. I recommend using an enum for messages as it offers exhaustiveness testing for robustness and has a compact internal representation.  TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION Bi-directional (duplex) communication is awkward to model with a single channel. An approach that’s simpler to work with is to create two sets of senders and receivers, one for each direction.  The channels-complex project provides an example of this two channel strategy. channels-complex is implemented in listings 10.25 and 10.26. These are available in ch10/ch10-channels-complex/Cargo.toml and ch10/ch10-channels-complex/src/ main.rs, respectively.  When executed, channels-complex produces three lines of output.

Listing 10.28 includes some additional complexity to han- dle this.  Previously, we created an empty Vec<Command> for the commands that we inter- preted from our input. Once parsed, main() repeatedly added elements via the vec- tor’s push() method. Now, at line 147, we fully initialize the vector. Its contents don’t matter. It will all be overwritten. Even so, I’ve chosen to use Command::Noop to ensure that a mistake won’t result in a corrupt SVG file.  10.5 Concurrency and task virtualization This section explains the difference between models of concurrency. Figure 10.5 dis- plays some of the trade-offs. The primary benefit of more costly forms of task virtualization is isolation. What is meant by the term isolation?  Isolated tasks cannot interfere with each other. Interference comes in many forms. Examples include corrupting memory, saturating the network, and congestion when saving to disk. If a thread is blocked while waiting for the console to print output to the screen, none of the coroutines acting in that thread are able to progress.  Isolated tasks cannot access each other’s data without permission. Independent threads in the same process share a memory address space, and all threads have equal access to data within that space. Processes, however, are prohibited from inspecting each other’s memory.  Isolated tasks cannot cause another task to crash. A failure in one task should not cascade into other systems. If a process induces a kernel panic, all processes are shut down. By conducting work in virtual machines, tasks can proceed even when other tasks are unstable. Concurrency Resources required Switch cost Isolation “Green” Thread Thread Process Container Virtual machine Figure 10.5 Trade-offs relating to different forms of task isolation in computing. In general terms,  increasing the isolation level increases the overhead.'},\n",

       "  'text': '361 Concurrency and task virtualization  Isolation is a continuum. Complete isolation is impractical. It implies that input and output is impossible. Moreover, isolation is often implemented in software. Run- ning extra software implies taking on extra runtime overhead. A small glossary of terms relating to concurrency This subfield is filled with jargon. Here is a brief introduction to some important terms and how we use them: \\uf0a1Program—A program, or application, is a brand name. It’s a name that we use to refer to a software package. When we execute a program, the OS creates a process. \\uf0a1Executable—A file that can be loaded into memory and then run. Running an executable means creating a process and a thread for it, then changing the CPU’s instruction pointer to the first instruction of the executable. \\uf0a1Task—This chapter uses the term task in an abstract sense. Its meaning shifts as the level of abstraction changes: a When discussing processes, a task is one of the process’s threads. b When referring to a thread, a task might be a function call. c When referring to an OS, a task might be a running program, which might be comprised of multiple processes. \\uf0a1Process—Running programs execute as processes. A process has its own vir- tual address space, at least one thread, and lots of bookkeeping managed by the OS. File descriptors, environment variables, and scheduling priorities are managed per process. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process identi- fier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, but can create additional threads from any of its threads. Running pro- grams begin their life as a single process, but it isn’t uncommon to spawn subprocesses to do the work. \\uf0a1Thread—The thread metaphor is used to hint that multiple threads can work together as a whole. \\uf0a1Thread of execution—A sequence of CPU instructions that appear in serial. Multiple threads can run concurrently, but instructions within the sequence are intended to be executed one after another. \\uf0a1Coroutine—Also known as fibre, green thread, and lightweight thread, a corou- tine indicates tasks that switch within a thread. Switching between tasks becomes the responsibility of the program itself, rather than the OS. Two the- oretical concepts are important to distinguish: a Concurrency, which is multiple tasks of any level of abstraction running at the same time b Parallelism, which is multiple threads executing on multiple CPUs at the same time'},\n",

       "  'text': '362 CHAPTER 10 Processes, threads, and containers 10.5.1 Threads A thread is the lowest level of isolation that an OS understands. The OS can schedule threads. Smaller forms of concurrency are invisible to the OS. You may have encoun- tered terms such as coroutines, fibers, and green threads.  Switching between tasks here is managed by the process itself. The OS is ignorant of the fact that a program is processing multiple tasks. For threads and other forms of concurrency, context switching is required.  10.5.2 What is a context switch? Switching between tasks at the same level of virtualization is known as a context switch. For threads to switch, CPU registers need to be cleared, CPU caches might need to be flushed, and variables within the OS need to be reset. As isolation increases, so does the cost of the context switch.  CPUs can only execute instructions in serial. To do more than one task, a com- puter, for example, needs to be able to press the Save Game button, switch to a new task, and resume at that task’s saved spot. The CPU is save scum.  Why is the CPU constantly switching tasks? Because it has so much time available. Programs often need to access data from memory, disk, or the network. Because wait- ing for data is incredibly slow, there’s often sufficient time to do something else in the meantime.  (continued) Outside of the fundamental terminology, there are also interrelated terms that appear frequently: asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O. Many operating sys- tems provide non-blocking I/O facilities, where data from multiple sockets is batched into queues and periodically polled as a group. Here are the definitions for these: \\uf0a1Non-blocking I/O—Normally a thread is unscheduled when it asks for data from I/O devices like the network. The thread is marked as blocked, while it waits for data to arrive. When programming with non-blocking I/O, the thread can continue execut- ing even while it waits for data. But there is a contradiction. How can a thread continue to execute if it doesn’t have any input data to process? The answer lies in asynchronous programming. \\uf0a1Asynchronous programming—Asynchronous programming describes program- ming for cases where the control flow is not predetermined. Instead, events outside the control of the program itself impact the sequence of what is exe- cuted. Those events are typically related to I/O, such as a device driver sig- nalling that it is ready, or are related to functions returning in another thread. The asynchronous programming model is typically more complicated for the developer, but results in a faster runtime for I/O-heavy workloads. Speed increases because there are fewer system calls. This implies fewer context switches between the user space and the kernel space.'},\n",

       "  'text': '363 Concurrency and task virtualization 10.5.3 Processes Threads exist within a process. The distinguishing characteristic of a process is that its memory is independent from other processes. The OS, in conjunction with the CPU, protects a process’s memory from all others.  To share data between processes, Rust channels and data protected by Arc<Mutex<_>> won’t suffice. You need some support from the OS. For this, reusing network sockets is common. Most operating systems provide specialized forms of interprocess communi- cation (IPC), which are faster, while being less portable.  10.5.4 WebAssembly WebAssembly (Wasm) is interesting because it is an attempt at isolating tasks within the process boundary itself. It’s impossible for tasks running inside a Wasm module to access memory available to other tasks. Originating in web browsers, Wasm treats all code as potentially hostile. If you use third-party dependencies, it’s likely that you haven’t verified the behavior of all of the code that your process executes.  In a sense, Wasm modules are given access to address spaces within your process’s address space. Wasm address spaces are called linear memory. Runtime interprets any request for data within linear memory and makes its own request to the actual virtual memory. Code within the Wasm module is unaware of any memory addresses that the process has access to.  10.5.5 Containers Containers are extensions to processes with further isolation provided by the OS. Pro- cesses share the same filesystem, whereas containers have a filesystem created for them. The same is true for other resources, such as the network. Rather than address space, the term used for protections covering these other resources is namespaces.  10.5.6 Why use an operating system (OS) at all? It’s possible to run an application as its own OS. Chapter 11 provides one implementa- tion. The general term for an application that runs without an OS is to describe it as freestanding—freestanding in the sense that it does not require the support of an OS. Freestanding binaries are used by embedded software developers when there is no OS to rely on.  Using freestanding binaries can involve significant limitations, though. Without an OS, applications no longer have virtual memory or multithreading. All of those con- cerns become your application’s concerns. To reach a middle ground, it is possible to compile a unikernel. A unikernel is a minimal OS paired with a single application. The compilation process strips out everything from the OS that isn’t used by the applica- tion that’s being deployed.'},\n",

Accordingly, the chapter is important for programmers who intend to work with Rust on embedded devices. 11.1 A fledgling operating system (FledgeOS) In this section, we’ll implement an OS kernel. The OS kernel performs several important roles, such as interacting with hardware and memory management, and coordinating work. Typically, work is coordinated through processes and threads.

Although the code may be short, it includes many concepts that are probably novel because they are not exposed to programmers who make use of an OS. Before getting started with the code, let’s see FledgeOS fly. 11.2.1 First boot FledgeOS is not the world’s most powerful operating system. Truthfully, it doesn’t look like much at all. At least it’s a graphical environment. As you can see from fig- ure 11.1, it creates a pale blue box in the top-left corner of the screen.  To get fledgeos-0 up and running, execute these commands from a command-line prompt: $ git clone https:/ /github.com/rust-in-action/code rust-in-action  Cloning into \\'rust-in-action\\'... ... $ cd rust-in-action/ch11/ch11-fledgeos-0  $ cargo +nightly run       ...

For now, success is being able to compile your own version of Rust, an OS kernel using that Rust, a bootloader that puts your kernel in the right place, and having these all work together.  Getting this far is a big achievement. As mentioned earlier, creating a program that targets an OS kernel that doesn’t exist yet is complicated. Several steps are required: 1 Create a machine-readable definition of the conventions that the OS uses, such as the intended CPU architecture. This is the target platform, also known as a com- piler target or simply target. You have seen targets before. Try executing rustup target list for a list that you can compile Rust to. 2 Compile Rust for the target definition to create the new target. We’ll suffice with a subset of Rust called core that excludes the standard library (crates under std). 3 Compile the OS kernel for the new target using the “new” Rust. 4 Compile a bootloader that can load the new kernel. 5 Execute the bootloader in a virtual environment, which, in turn, runs the kernel. Thankfully, the bootimage crate does all of this for us. With all of that fully automated, we’re able to focus on the interesting pieces.

Here are some of the changes to ordinary programs that are intended to be executed along- side an OS: \\uf0a1The central FledgeOS functions never return. There is no place to return to. There are no other running programs. To indicate this, our functions’ return type is the Never type (!). \\uf0a1If the program crashes, the whole computer crashes. The only thing that our program can do when an error occurs is terminate. We indicate this by relying on LLVM’s abort() function. This is explained in more detail in section 11.2.4. \\uf0a1We must disable the standard library with ![no_std]. As our application cannot rely on an OS to provide dynamic memory allocation, it’s important to avoid any code that dynamically allocates memory. The ![no_std] annotation excludes the Rust standard library from our crate. This has the side effect of preventing many types, such as Vec<T>, from being available to our program. \\uf0a1We need to unlock the unstable core_intrinsics API with the #![core_intrinsics] attribute. Part of the Rust compiler is provided by LLVM, the compiler produced by the LLVM project. LLVM exposes parts of its internals to Rust, which are known as intrinsic functions. As LLVM’s internals are not subject to Rust’s stabil- ity guarantees, there is always a risk that what is offered to Rust will change. Therefore, this implies that we must use the nightly compiler toolchain and explicitly opt into the unstable API in our program. \\uf0a1We need to disable the Rust symbol-naming conventions with the #![no_mangle] attribute. Symbol names are strings within the compiled binary. For multiple libraries to coexist at runtime, it’s important that these names do not collide. Ordinarily, Rust avoids this by creating symbols via a process called name mangling.

An operating system’s calling convention relates to the way function arguments are laid out in mem- ory, among other details. Rust does not define its calling convention. By anno- tating the _start() function with extern \"C\", we instruct Rust to use the C language’s calling conventions. Without this, the boot process may fail. \\uf0a1Writing directly to memory changes the display. Traditionally, operating systems used a simplistic model for adjusting the screen’s output. A predefined block of memory, known as the frame buffer, was monitored by the video hardware. When the frame buffer changed, the display changed to match. One standard, used by our bootloader, is VGA (Video Graphics Array). The bootloader sets up address 0xb8000 as the start of the frame buffer. Changes to its memory are reflected onscreen. This is explained in detail in section 11.2.5. \\uf0a1We should disable the inclusion of a main() function with the #![no_main] attri- bute. The main() function is actually quite special because its arguments are provided by a function that is ordinarily included by the compiler (_start()), and its return values are interpreted before the program exits. The behavior of main() is part of the Rust runtime. Read section 11.2.6 for more details. Now that our first kernel is live, let’s learn a little bit about how it works. First, let’s look at panic handling.  11.2.4 Panic handling Rust won’t allow you to compile a program that doesn’t have a mechanism to deal with panics. Normally, it inserts panic handling itself. This is one of the actions of the Rust runtime, but we started our code with #[no_std]. Avoiding the standard library is useful in that it greatly simplifies compilation, but manual panic handling is one of its costs. The following listing is an excerpt from listing 11.4. It introduces our panic- handling functionality.  1 #![no_std]  2 #![no_main] Where to go to learn more about OS development The cargo bootimage command takes care of lots of nuisances and irritation. It pro- vides a simple interface—a single command—to a complicated process. But if you’re a tinkerer, you might like to know what’s happening beneath the surface. In that case, you should search Philipp Oppermann’s blog, “Writing an OS in Rust,” at https://os .phil-opp.com/ and look into the small ecosystem of tools that has emerged from it at https://github.com/rust-osdev/.

We could use an infinite loop as the panic handler, shown in the following listing. The disadvantage of that approach is that any errors in the program trigger the CPU core to run at 100% until it is shut down manually. #[panic_handler] #[no_mangle] pub fn panic(_info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {   loop { } } The PanicInfo struct provides information about where the panic originates. This information includes the filename and line number of the source code. It’ll come in handy when we implement proper panic handling.  11.2.5 Writing to the screen with VGA-compatible text mode The bootloader sets some magic bytes with raw assembly code in boot mode. At startup, the bytes are interpreted by the hardware. The hardware switches its display to an 80x25 grid. It also sets up a fixed-memory buffer that is interpreted by the hard- ware for printing to the screen. Listing 11.6 Using an infinite loop as a panic handler VGA-compatible text mode in 20 seconds Normally, the display is split into an 80x25 grid of cells. Each cell is represented in memory by 2 bytes. In Rust-like syntax, those bytes include several fields. The follow- ing code snippet shows the fields: struct VGACell {     is_blinking: u1,            background_color: u3,       is_bright: u1,              character_color: u3,        character: u8,       } These four fields  occupy a single  byte in memory. Available characters are drawn from  the code page 437 encoding, which is  (approximately) an extension of ASCII.'},\n",

       "  'text': '376 CHAPTER 11 Kernel This initialization at boot time makes it easy to display things onscreen. Each of the points in the 80x25 grid are mapped to locations in memory. This area of memory is called the frame buffer.  Our bootloader designates 0xb8000 as the start of a 4,000 byte frame buffer. To actually set the value, our code uses two new methods, offset() and write_volatile(), that you haven’t encountered before. The following listing, an excerpt from listing 11.4, shows how these are used. 18   let mut framebuffer = 0xb8000 as *mut u8; 19   unsafe { 20       framebuffer 21         .offset(1) 22         .write_volatile(0x30); 23   } Here is a short explanation of the two new methods: \\uf0a1Moving through an address space with offset()—A pointer type’s offset() method moves through the address space in increments that align to the size of the pointer. For example, calling .offset(1) on a *mut u8 (mutable pointer to a u8) adds 1 to its address. When that same call is made to a *mut u32 (mutable pointer to a u32), the pointer’s address moves by 4 bytes. \\uf0a1Forcing a value to be written to memory with write_volatile()—Pointers provide a write_volatile() method that issues a “volatile” write. Volatile prevents the compiler’s optimizer from optimizing away the write instruction. A smart com- piler might simply notice that we are using lots of constants everywhere and ini- tialize the program such that the memory is simply set to the value that we want it to be. (continued) VGA text mode has a 16-color palette, where 3 bits make up the main 8 colors. Fore- ground colors also have an additional bright variant, shown in the following: #[repr(u8)] enum Color {     Black = 0,    White = 8,     Blue = 1,     BrightBlue = 9,     Green = 2,    BrightGreen = 10,     Cyan = 3,     BrightCyan = 11,     Red = 4,      BrightRed = 12,     Magenta = 5,  BrightMagenta = 13,     Brown = 6,    Yellow = 14,     Gray = 7,     DarkGray = 15, } Listing 11.7 Focusing on modifying the VGA frame buffer'},\n",

Here we use the dereference operator (*) and manually set the memory to 0x30. 18   let mut framebuffer = 0xb8000 as *mut u8; 19   unsafe { 20       *(framebuffer + 1) = 0x30;    21   } The coding style from listing 11.8 may be more familiar to programmers who have worked heavily with pointers before. Using this style requires diligence. Without the aid of type safety provided by offset(), it’s easy for a typo to cause memory corrup- tion. The verbose coding style used in listing 11.7 is also friendlier to programmers with less experience performing pointer arithmetic. It declares its own intent.  11.2.6 _start(): The main() function for FledgeOS An OS kernel does not include the concept of a main() function, in the sense that you’re used to. For one thing, an OS kernel’s main loop never returns. Where would it return to? By convention, programs return an error code when they exit to an OS. But operating systems don’t have an OS to provide an exit code to. Secondly, starting a program at main() is also a convention. But that convention also doesn’t exist for OS kernels. To start an OS kernel, we require some software to talk directly to the CPU. The software is called a bootloader.  The linker expects to see one symbol defined, _start, which is the program’s entry point. It links _start to a function that’s defined by your source code.  In an ordinary environment, the _start() function has three jobs. Its first is to reset the system. On an embedded system, for example, _start() might clear regis- ters and reset memory to 0. Its second job is to call main(). Its third is to call _exit(), which cleans up after main(). Our _start() function doesn’t perform the last two jobs. Job two is unnecessary as the application’s functionality is simple enough to keep within _start(). Job three is unnecessary, as is main(). If it were to be called, it would never return.  11.3 fledgeos-1: Avoiding a busy loop Now that the foundations are in place, we can begin to add features to FledgeOS. 11.3.1 Being power conscious by interacting with the CPU directly Before proceeding, FledgeOS needs to address one major shortcoming: it is extremely power hungry. The _start() function from listing 11.4 actually runs a CPU core at 100%. It’s possible to avoid this by issuing the halt instruction (hlt) to the CPU.  The halt instruction, referred to as HLT in the technical literature, notifies the CPU that there’s no more work to be done. The CPU resumes operating when an Listing 11.8 Manually incrementing a pointer Sets the memory location  0xb8001 to 0x30'},\n",

Another approach to explore is to use inline assembly. The latter approach is demonstrated briefly in section 12.3.  11.4 fledgeos-2: Custom exception handling The next iteration of FledgeOS improves on its error-handling capabilities. FledgeOS still crashes when an error is triggered, but we now have a framework for building something more sophisticated. 11.4.1 Handling exceptions properly, almost FledgeOS cannot manage any exceptions generated from the CPU when it detects an abnormal operation. To handle exceptions, our program needs to define an exception- handling personality function.  Personality functions are called on each stack frame as the stack is unwound after an exception. This means the call stack is traversed, invoking the personality function at each stage. The personality function’s role is to determine whether the current stack frame is able to handle the exception. Exception handling is also known as catch- ing an exception. NOTE What is stack unwinding? When functions are called, stack frames accu- mulate. Traversing the stack in reverse is called unwinding. Eventually, unwind- ing the stack will hit _start(). Because handling exceptions in a rigorous way is not necessary for FledgeOS, we’ll implement only the bare minimum. Listing 11.11, an excerpt from listing 11.12, pro- vides a snippet of code with the minimal handler. Inject it into main.rs. An empty function implies that any exception is fatal because none will be marked as the han- dler. When an exception occurs, we don’t need to do anything. 4 #![feature(lang_items)] 18 #[lang = \"eh_personality\"] 19 #[no_mangle] 20 pub extern \"C\" fn eh_personality() { } Listing 11.11 Minimalist exception-handling personality routine'},\n",

This section explains the process of sending text to the frame buf- fer in more detail. Figure 11.2 shows the output from running fledgeos-3. 11.5.1 Writing colored text to the screen To start, we’ll create a type for the color numeric constants that are used later in list- ing 11.16. Using an enum rather than defining a series of const values provides enhanced type safety. In some sense, it adds a semantic relationship between the val- ues. These are all treated as members of the same group.  The following listing defines an enum that represents the VGA-compatible text mode color palette. The mapping between bit patterns and colors is defined by the VGA standard, and our code should comply with it.  9 #[allow(unused)]          10 #[derive(Clone,Copy)]    11 #[repr(u8)]              12 enum Color { 13   Black = 0x0,    White = 0xF, 14   Blue = 0x1,     BrightBlue = 0x9, 15   Green = 0x2,    BrightGreen = 0xA, 16   Cyan = 0x3,     BrightCyan = 0xB, Listing 11.13 Representing related numeric constants as an enum Figure 11.2 Output produced by fledgeos-3 We won’t be using every  color variant in our code, so  we can silence warnings.

But there are times when we need to pull in the reins. External systems often demand that our data matches their requirements.  Listing 11.13 provides an example of fitting the colors from the VGA-compatible text mode palette enum into a single u8. It removes any discretion from the compiler about which bit pattern (formally called the discriminant) to associate with particular variants. To prescribe a representation, add the repr attribute. You are then able to specify any integer type (i32, u8, i16, u16,…), as well as some special cases.  Using a prescribed representation has some disadvantages. In particular, it reduces your flexibility. It also prevents Rust from making space optimizations. Some enums, those with a single variant, require no representation. These appear in source code but occupy zero space in the running program.  11.5.3 Why use enums? You could model colors differently. For instance, it’s possible to create numeric con- stants that look identical in memory. The following shows one such possibility: const BLACK: u8 = 0x0; const BLUE: u8 = 0x1; // ... Using an enum adds an extra guard. It becomes much more difficult to use an illegal value in our code than if we were using an u8 directly. You will see this demonstrated when the Cursor struct is introduced in listing 11.17.  11.5.4 Creating a type that can print to the VGA frame buffer To print to the screen, we’ll use a Cursor struct that handles the raw memory manipu- lation and can convert between our Color type and what is expected by VGA. As the following listing shows, this type manages the interface between our code and the VGA frame buffer. This listing is another excerpt from listing 11.16. 25 struct Cursor { 26   position: isize, 27   foreground: Color, 28   background: Color, 29 } 30  Listing 11.14 Definition and methods for Cursor'},\n",

Functionality that you take for granted, such as dynamic memory or multithreading, is not available to you. \\uf0a1In environments such as embedded systems that do not have dynamic memory management, you will need to avoid the Rust standard library with the #![no_std] annotation. \\uf0a1When interfacing with external components, naming symbols becomes signif- icant. To opt out of Rust’s name-mangling facilities, use the #![no_mangle] attribute. \\uf0a1Rust’s internal representations can be controlled through annotations. For exam- ple, annotating an enum with #![repr(u8]) forces the values to be packed into a single byte. If this doesn’t work, Rust refuses to compile the program. \\uf0a1Raw pointer manipulation is available to you, but type-safe alternatives exist. When it’s practical to do so, use the offset() method to correctly calculate the number of bytes to traverse through the address space. \\uf0a1The compiler’s internals are always accessible to you at the cost of requiring a nightly compiler. Access compiler intrinsics like intrinsics::abort() to pro- vide functionality to the program that’s ordinarily inaccessible. \\uf0a1cargo should be thought of as an extensible tool. It sits at the center of the Rust programmer’s workflow, but its standard behavior can be changed when necessary. \\uf0a1To access raw machine instructions, such as HTL, you can use helper crates like x86_64 or rely on inline assembly. \\uf0a1Don’t be afraid to experiment. With modern tools like QEMU, the worst that can happen is that your tiny OS crashes, and you’ll need to run it again instantly.'},\n",

The network constantly interrupts program execution when bytes are ready to be delivered. This means that after connecting to a database (or at any other time), the OS can demand that your application deal with a message. This chapter describes this process and how to prepare your programs for it.  In chapter 9, you learned that a digital clock periodically notifies the OS that time has progressed. This chapter explains how those notifications occur. It also introduces the concept of multiple applications running at the same time via the concept of signals. Signals emerged as part of the UNIX OS tradition. These can be used to send messages between different running programs.  We’ll address both concepts—signals and interrupts—together, as the program- ming models are similar. But it’s simpler to start with signals.

       "  'text': '391 Glossary focuses on the Linux OS running on x86 CPUs, that’s not to say that users of other operating systems won’t be able to follow along. 12.1 Glossary Learning how CPUs, device drivers, applications, and operating systems interact is dif- ficult. There is a lot of jargon to take in. To make matters worse, the terms all look sim- ilar, and it certainly does not help that these are often used interchangeably. Here are some examples of the jargon that is used in this chapter. Figure 12.1 illustrates how these interrelate: \\uf0a1Abort—An unrecoverable exception. If an application triggers an abort, the application terminates. \\uf0a1Fault—A recoverable exception that is expected in routine operations such as a page fault. Page faults occur when a memory address is not available and data must be fetched from the main memory chip(s). This process is known as vir- tual memory and is explained in section 4 of chapter 6. \\uf0a1Exception—Exception is an umbrella term that incudes aborts, faults, and traps. Formally referred to as synchronous interrupts, exceptions are sometimes described as a form of an interrupt. \\uf0a1Hardware interrupt—An interrupt generated by a device such as a keyboard or hard disk controller. Typically used by devices to notify the CPU that data is available to be read from the device. \\uf0a1Interrupt—A hardware-level term that is used in two senses. It can refer only to synchronous interrupts, which include hardware and software interrupts. Depend- ing on context, it can also include exceptions. Interrupts are usually handled by the OS. \\uf0a1Signal—An OS-level term for interruptions to an application’s control flow. Sig- nals are handled by applications. \\uf0a1Software interrupt—An interrupt generated by a program. Within Intel’s x86 CPU family, programs can trigger an interrupt with the INT instruction. Among other uses of this facility, debuggers use software interrupts to set breakpoints. \\uf0a1Trap—A recoverable exception such as an integer overflow detected by the CPU. Integer overflow is explained in section 5.2. NOTE The meaning of the term exception may differ from your previous pro- gramming experience. Programming languages often use the term exception to refer to any error, whereas the term has a specialized meaning when refer- ring to CPUs. 12.1.1 Signals vs. interrupts The two concepts that are most important to distinguish between are signals and interrupts. A signal is a software-level abstraction that is associated with an OS. An inter- rupt is a CPU-related abstraction that is closely associated with the system’s hardware.'},\n",

       "  'text': '392 CHAPTER 12 Signals, interrupts, and exceptions Signals are a form of limited interprocess communication. They don’t contain con- tent, but their presence indicates something. They’re analogous to a physical, audible buzzer. The buzzer doesn’t provide content, but the person who presses it still knows what’s intended as it makes a very jarring sound. To add confusion to the mix, signals are often described as software interrupts. This chapter, however, avoids the use of the term interrupt when referring to a signal.  There are two forms of interrupts, which differ in their origin. One form of inter- rupt occurs within the CPU during its processing. This is the result of attempting to process illegal instructions and trying to access invalid memory addresses. This first form is known technically as a synchronous interrupt, but you may have heard it referred to by its more common name, exception.  The second form of interrupt is generated by hardware devices like keyboards and accelerometers. This is what’s commonly implied by the term interrupt. This can occur at any time and is formally known as an asynchronous interrupt. Like signals, this can also be generated within software.  Interrupts can be specialized. A trap is an error detected by the CPU, so it gives the OS a chance to recover. A fault is another form of a recoverable problem. If the CPU is given a memory address that it can’t read from, it notifies the OS and asks for an updated address. Exceptions Faults Recoverable Page fault Traps Recoverable Integer overﬂow Aborts Unrecoverable Double fault (second fault occurred while handling ﬁrst) Interrupts Interrupts Devices reporting that data is ready Software deﬁned CPU given INT instruction (on x86) Hardware deﬁned Intel deﬁnes three forms of exception classes. Often, the single term is used to cover both concepts. Figure 12.1 A visual taxonomy of how the terms interrupt, exception, trap, and fault interact within  Intel’s x86 family of CPUs.

       "  'text': '393 How interrupts affect applications  Interrupts force an application’s control flow to change, whereas many signals can be ignored if desired. Upon receiving an interrupt, the CPU jumps to handler code, irrespective of the current state of the program. The location of the handler code is predefined by the BIOS and OS during a system’s bootup process. 12.2 How interrupts affect applications Let’s work through this challenge by considering a small code example. The following listing shows a simple calculation that sums two integers. 1 fn add(a: i32, b:i32) -> i32 { 2   a + b 3 } 4  5 fn main() { 6   let a = 5; 7   let b = 6; 8   let c = add(a,b); 9 } Irrespective of the number of hardware interrupts, c is always calculated. But the pro- gram’s wall clock time becomes nondeterministic because the CPU performs different tasks every time it runs. Treating signals as interrupts Handling interrupts directly means manipulating the OS kernel. Because we would prefer not to do that in a learning environment, we’ll play fast and loose with the ter- minology. The rest of this chapter, therefore, treats signals as interrupts. Why simplify things? Writing OS components involves tweaking the kernel. Breaking things there means that our system could become completely unresponsive without a clear way to fix anything. From a more pragmatic perspective, avoiding tweaks to the kernel means that we’ll avoid learning a whole new compiler toolchain. To our advantage, code that handles signals looks similar to code that handles inter- rupts. Practicing with signals allows us to keep any errors within our code constrained to our application rather than risk bringing the whole system down. The general pat- tern is as follows: 1 Model your application’s standard control flow. 2 Model the interrupted control flow and identify resources that need to be cleanly shut down, if required. 3 Write the interrupt/signal handler to update some state and return quickly. 4 You will typically delegate time-consuming operations by only modifying a global variable that is regularly checked by the main loop of the program. 5 Modify your application’s standard control flow to look for the GO/NO GO flag that a signal handler may have changed.

       "  'text': '394 CHAPTER 12 Signals, interrupts, and exceptions  When an interrupt occurs, the CPU immediately halts execution of the program and jumps to the interrupt handler. The next listing (illustrated in figure 12.2) details what happens when an interrupt occurs between lines 7 and 8 in listing 12.1.  1 #[allow(unused)]  2 fn interrupt_handler() {     3   / / ..  4 }  5   6 fn add(a: i32, b:i32) -> i32 {  7   a + b  8 }  9  10 fn main() { 11   let a = 5; 12   let b = 6; 13  14   / / Key pressed on keyboard! 15   interrupt_handler() 16  17   let c = add(a,b); 18 } Listing 12.2 Depicting the flow of listing 12.1 as it handles an interrupt Although presented in  this listing as an extra  function, the interrupt  handler is typically  defined by the OS. let b = 6; let a = 5; main() .... add(a,b) add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 let c = ... a + b RETURN Normal program execution Control ﬂow in the normal case operates in a linear sequence of instructions. Function calls and return statements do jump a CPU around in memory, but the order of events can be predetermined. let b = 6; let a = 5; main() .... add(a,b) add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 let c = ... a + b RETURN Interrupted program execution When a hardware interrupt occurs, the program is not unaﬀected directly, although there may be a negligible performance impact as the operating system must deal with the hardware. ?

       "  'text': '395 Signal handling One important point to remember is that, from the program’s perspective, little changes. It isn’t aware that its control flow has been interrupted. Listing 12.1 is still an accurate representation of the program.  12.3 Software interrupts Software interrupts are generated by programs sending specific instructions to the CPU. To do this in Rust, you can invoke the asm! macro. The following code, available at ch12/asm.rs, provides a brief view of the syntax: #![feature(asm)]      use std::asm; fn main() {     unsafe {         asm!(\"int 42\");     } } Running the compiled executable presents the following error from the OS: $ rustc +nightly asm.rs  $ ./asm  Segmentation fault (core dumped) As of Rust 1.50, the asm! macro is unstable and requires that you execute the nightly Rust compiler. To install the nightly compiler, use rustup: $ rustup install nightly 12.4 Hardware interrupts Hardware interrupts have a special flow. Devices interface with a specialized chip, known as the Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC), to notify the CPU. Figure 12.3 pro- vides a view of how interrupts flow from hardware devices to an application.  12.5 Signal handling Signals require immediate attention. Failing to handling a signal typically results in the application being terminated. 12.5.1 Default behavior Sometimes the best approach is to let the system’s defaults do the work. Code that you don’t need to write is code that’s free from bugs that you inadvertently cause.  The default behavior for most signals is shutting down the application. When an application does not provide a special handler function (we’ll learn how to do that in this chapter), the OS considers the signal to be an abnormal condition. When an OS detects an abnormal condition within an application, things don’t end well for the application—it terminates the application. Figure 12.4 depicts this scenario.

SIGSTOP halts the program’s execution, and it remains suspended until it receives SIGCONT. UNIX systems use this signal for job control.

Programs can avoid the others.  12.6 Handling signals with custom actions The default actions for signals are fairly limited. By default, receiving a signal tends to end badly for applications. For example, if external resources such as database connec- tions are left open, they might not be cleaned up properly when the application ends.  The most common use case for signal handlers is to allow an application to shut down cleanly. Some common tasks that might be necessary when an application shuts down include \\uf0a1Flushing the hard disk drive to ensure that pending data is written to disk \\uf0a1Closing any network connections \\uf0a1Deregistering from any distributed scheduler or work queue To stop the current workload and shut down, a signal handler is required. To set up a signal handler, we need to create a function with the signature f(i32) -> (). That is, the function needs to accept an i32 integer as its sole argument and returns no value.  This poses some software engineering issues. The signal handler isn’t able to access any information from the application except which signal was sent. Therefore, because it doesn’t know what state anything is in, it doesn’t know what needs shutting down beforehand.  There are some additional restrictions in addition to the architectural one. Signal handlers are constrained in time and scope. These must also act quickly within a sub- set of functionality available to general code for these reasons: \\uf0a1Signal handlers can block other signals of the same type from being handled. \\uf0a1Moving fast reduces the likelihood of operating alongside another signal han- dler of a different type. SIGKILL Kill Terminate This action is unstoppable. SIGQUIT Quit Writes memory to disk as a  core dump, then terminates.

       "  'text': '401 Handling signals with custom actions Signal handlers have reduced scope in what they’re permitted to do. For example, they must avoid executing any code that might itself generate signals.  To wriggle out of this constrained environment, the ordinary approach is to use a Boolean flag as a global variable that is regularly checked during a program’s execution. If the flag is set, then you can call a function to shutdown the application cleanly within the context of the application. For this pattern to work, there are two requirements: \\uf0a1The signal handler’s sole responsibility is to mutate the flag. \\uf0a1The application must regularly check the flag to detect whether the flag has been modified. To avoid race conditions caused by multiple signal handlers running at the same time, signal handlers typically do little. A common pattern is to set a flag via a global variable. 12.6.1 Global variables in Rust Rust facilitates global variables (variables accessible anywhere within the program) by declaring a variable with the static keyword in global scope. Suppose we want to cre- ate a global value SHUT_DOWN that we can set to true when a signal handler believes it’s time to urgently shut down. We can use this declaration: static mut SHUT_DOWN: bool = false; NOTE static mut is read as mutable static, irrespective of how grammatically contorted that is. Global variables present an issue for Rust programmers. Accessing these (even just for reading) is unsafe. This means that the code can become quite cluttered if it’s wrapped in unsafe blocks. This ugliness is a signal to wary programmers—avoid global state whenever possible.  Listing 12.6 presents a example of a static mut variable that reads from line 12 and writes to lines 7–9. The call to rand::random() on line 8 produces Boolean val- ues. Output is a series of dots. About 50% of the time, you’ll receive output that looks like what’s shown in the following console session:1 $ git clone https:/ /github.com/rust-in-action/code rust-in-action $ cd rust-in-action/ch12/ch2-toy-global $ cargo run -q  .

In the next example, we’ll set a variable to indicate that the program needs to shut down. This technique is demonstrated by listing 12.8, which is struc- tured into these three functions: \\uf0a1 register_signal_handlers()—Communicates to the OS via libc, the signal handler for each signal. This function makes use of a function pointer, which treats a function as data. Function pointers are explained in section 11.7.1. \\uf0a1 handle_signals()—Handles incoming signals. This function is agnostic as to which signal is sent, although we’ll only deal with SIGTERM. \\uf0a1 main()—Initializes the program and iterates through a main loop. When run, the resulting executable produces a trace of where it is. The following con- sole session shows the trace: Listing 12.5 Crate metadata for listing 12.6 Listing 12.6 Accessing global variables (mutable statics) in Rust Reading from and writing  to a static mut variable  requires an unsafe block. rand::random() is a shortcut that  calls rand::thread_rng().gen() to  produce a random value.

Rust’s fn keyword creates func- tion pointers. handle_sigterm() and handle_sigusr1() both have the type fn(i32) -> (). We need to cast these as usize values to erase any type information. Function pointers are explained in more detail in section 12.7.1. Calling libc functions is  unsafe; their effects are  outside of Rust’s control.

Within your business rules, you can create definitions for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. These are unallocated by design. In listing 12.8, we used SIGUSR1 to do a small task. It simply prints the string SIGUSR1. A more realistic use of custom signals is to notify a peer application that some data is ready for further processing. 12.7.1 Understanding function pointers and their syntax Listing 12.8 includes some syntax that might be confusing. For example, on line 40 handle_sigterm as usize appears to cast a function as an integer.  What is happening here? The address where the function is stored is being con- verted to an integer. In Rust, the fn keyword creates a function pointer.  Readers who have worked through chapter 5 will understand that functions are just data. That is to say, functions are sequences of bytes that make sense to the CPU. A function pointer is a pointer to the start of that sequence. Refer back to chapter 5, especially section 5.7, for a refresher.  A pointer is a data type that acts as a stand-in for its referent. Within an application’s source code, pointers contain both the address of the value referred to as well as its type. The type information is something that’s stripped away in the compiled binary. The internal representation for pointers is an integer of usize. That makes pointers very economical to pass around. In C, making use of function pointers can feel like arcane magic. In Rust, they hide in plain sight.   Understanding the difference between const and static Static and constant seem similar. Here is the main difference between them: \\uf0a1 static values appear in a single location in memory. \\uf0a1 const values can be duplicated in locations where they are accessed. Duplicating const values can be a CPU-friendly optimization. It allows for data locality and improved cache performance. Why use confusingly similar names for two different things? It could be considered a historical accident. The word static refers to the segment of the address space that the variables live in. static values live outside the stack space, within the region where string literals are held, near the bottom of the address space. That means accessing a static variable almost certainly implies dereferencing a pointer. The constant in const values refers to the value itself. When accessed from code, the data might get duplicated to every location that it’s needed if the compiler believes that this will result in faster access.'},\n",

That means that list- ing 12.9 is legal code and should print something similar to the following line: $ rustc ch12/fn-ptr-demo-1.rs && ./fn-ptr-demo-1  noop as usize: 0x5620bb4af530 NOTE In the output, 0x5620bb4af530 is the memory address (in hexadeci- mal notation) of the start of the noop() function. This number will be differ- ent on your machine. The following listing, available at ch12/noop.rs, shows how to cast a function to usize. This demonstrates how usize can be used as a function pointer. fn noop() {} fn main() {     let fn_ptr = noop as usize;     println!(\"noop as usize: 0x{:x}\", fn_ptr); } But what is the type of the function pointer created from fn noop()? To describe function pointers, Rust reuses its function signature syntax. In the case of fn noop(), the type is *const fn() -> (). This type is read as “a const pointer to a function that takes no arguments and returns unit.” A const pointer is immutable. A unit is Rust’s stand-in value for “nothingness.”  Listing 12.10 casts a function pointer to usize and then back again. Its output, shown in the following snippet, should show two lines that are nearly identical: $ rustc ch12/fn-ptr-demo-2.rs && ./fn-ptr-demo-2  noop as usize:    0x55ab3fdb05c0 noop as *const T: 0x55ab3fdb05c0 NOTE These two numbers will be different on your machine, but the two numbers will match each other. fn noop() {} fn main() {   let fn_ptr = noop as usize;   let typed_fn_ptr = noop as *const fn() -> ();   println!(\"noop as usize:    0x{:x}\", fn_ptr);   println!(\"noop as *const T: {:p}\", typed_fn_ptr);    } Listing 12.9 Casting a function to usize Listing 12.10 Casting a function to usize Note the use of the  pointer format  modifier, {:p}.'},\n",

When receiving a signal, the program might want to execute some cleanup code before terminating (or being forcefully terminated). This is sometimes referred to as nonlocal control transfer. UNIX-based operating systems provide some tools to enable you to make use of that machinery via two system calls—setjmp and longjmp: \\uf0a1 setjmp sets a marker location. \\uf0a1 longjmp jumps back to the previously marked location. Why bother with such programming gymnastics? Sometimes using low-level tech- niques like these is the only way out of a tight spot. These approach the “Dark Arts” of systems programming. To quote the manpage: “setjmp() and longjmp() are useful for dealing with errors and interrupts encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.” —Linux Documentation Project: setjmp(3) These two tools circumvent normal control flow and allow programs to teleport them- selves through the code. Occasionally an error occurs deep within a call stack. If our program takes too long to respond to the error, the OS may simply abort the program, and the program’s data may be left in an inconsistent state. To avoid this, you can use longjmp to shift control directly to the error-handling code.  To understand the significance of this, consider what happens in an ordinary pro- gram’s call stack during several calls to a recursive function as produced by the code in listing 12.13. Each call to dive() adds another place that control eventually returns to. See the left-hand side of table 12.3. The longjmp system call, used by listing 12.17, bypasses several layers of the call stack. Its effect on the call stack is visible on the right- hand side of table 12.3. Table 12.3 Comparing the intended output from listing 12.13 and listing 12.17 Listing 12.13 produces a symmetrical pattern.  Each level is caused by a nested call to dive(),  which is removed when the calls return. Listing 12.17 produces a much different pattern.  After a few calls to dive(), control teleports back  to main() without returning the calls to dive(). # ## ### #### ##### ### ## # # ## ### early return! finishing!

On the right side, the code jumps directly from the third call to the top to the call stack.  The following listing depicts how the call stack operates by printing its progress as the program executes. The code for this listing is in ch10/ch10-callstack/src/main.rs.  1 fn print_depth(depth:usize) {  2     for _ in 0..depth {  3         print!(\"#\");  4     }  5     println!(\"\");  6 }  7   8 fn dive(depth: usize, max_depth: usize) {  9     print_depth(depth); 10     if depth >= max_depth { 11         return; 12  13     } else { 14         dive(depth+1, max_depth); 15     } 16     print_depth(depth); 17 } 18  19 fn main() { 20     dive(0, 5); 21 } There’s a lot of work to do to make this happen. The Rust language itself doesn’t have the tools to enable this control-flow trickery. It needs to access some provided by its compiler’s toolchain. Compilers provide special functions known as intrinsics to appli- cation programs. Using an intrinsic function with Rust takes some ceremony to set up, but that operates as a standard function once the set-up is in place. 12.9.1 Introducing the sjlj project The sjlj project demonstrates contorting the normal control flow of a function. With the help of some assistance from the OS and the compiler, it’s actually possi- ble to create a situation where a function can move to anywhere in the program. Listing 12.17 uses that functionality to bypass several layers of the call stack, creating the output from the right side of table 12.3. Figure 12.5 shows the control flow for the sjlj project.  12.9.2 Setting up intrinsics in a program Listing 12.17 uses two intrinsics, setjmp() and longjmp().

We’ll answer the following shortly: \\uf0a1What is an intrinsic function? \\uf0a1What is LLVM? Additionally, we need to tell Rust about the functions that are being provided by LLVM. Rust won’t know anything about them, apart from their type signatures, which means that any use of these must occur within an unsafe block. The following listing shows how to inform Rust about the LLVM functions. The source for this listing is in ch12/ch12-sjlj/src/main.rs.

For example \\uf0a1 extern \"C\" means “This block of code should obey C’s conventions rather than Rust’s.” \\uf0a1The link_name attribute tells the linker where to find the two functions that we’re declaring. \\uf0a1The eh in llvm.eh.sjlj.setjmp stands for exception handling, and the sjlj stands for setjmp/longjmp. \\uf0a1 *mut i8 is a pointer to a signed byte. For those with C programming experi- ence, you might recognize this as the pointer to the beginning of a string (e.g., a *char type). WHAT IS AN INTRINSIC FUNCTION? Intrinsic functions, generally referred to as intrinsics, are functions made available via the compiler rather than as part of the language. Whereas Rust is largely target-agnostic, the compiler has access to the target environment. This access can facilitate extra functionality. For example, a compiler understands the characteristics of the CPU that the to-be-compiled program will run on. The compiler can make that CPU’s instruc- tions available to the program via intrinsics. Some examples of intrinsic functions include \\uf0a1Atomic operations—Many CPUs provide specialist instructions to optimize certain workloads. For example, the CPU might guarantee that updating an integer is an atomic operation. Atomic here is meant in the sense of being indivisible. This can be extremely important when dealing with concurrent code. \\uf0a1Exception handling—The facilities provided by CPUs for managing exceptions differ. These facilities can be used by programming language designers to cre- ate custom control flow. The setjmp and longjmp intrinsics, introduced later in this chapter, fall into this camp.  WHAT IS LLVM? From the point of view of Rust programmers, LLVM can be considered as a subcom- ponent of rustc, the Rust compiler. LLVM is an external tool that’s bundled with rustc. Rust programmers can draw from the tools it provides. One set of tools that LLVM provides is intrinsic functions.

LLVM translates code produced by rustc, which produces LLVM IR (intermediate language) into machine-readable assembly language. To make matters more compli- cated, another tool, called a linker, is required to stitch multiple crates together. On Windows, Rust uses link.exe, a program provided by Microsoft as its linker. On other operating systems, the GNU linker ld is used.  Understanding more detail about LLVM implies learning more about rustc and compilation in general. Like many things, getting closer to the truth requires explor- ing through a fractal-like domain. Learning every subsystem seems to require learning about another set of subsystems. Explaining more here would be a fascinating, but ultimately distracting diversion.  12.9.3 Casting a pointer to another type One of the more arcane parts of Rust’s syntax is how to cast between pointer types. You’ll encounter this as you make your way through listing 12.17. But problems can arise because of the type signatures of setjmp() and longjmp(). In this code snippet, extracted from listing 12.17, you can see that both functions take a *mut i8 pointer as an argument: extern \"C\" {   #[link_name = \"llvm.eh.sjlj.setjmp\"]   pub fn setjmp(_: *mut i8) -> i32;   #[link_name = \"llvm.eh.sjlj.longjmp\"]   pub fn longjmp(_: *mut i8); } Text editor Produces rustc cargo Read by Invokes invokes llvm Optimized by linker Produces Combined by Produces External crates Target CPU Produces Informs Combined by rustc invokes Informally referred to as rustc Environment Tool Source code LLVM IR Assembly Executable ﬁle In the case of lib crates, binary files that can be linked to other crates later on Artifact Figure 12.6 Some of the major steps required to generate an executable from Rust source code.

       "  'text': '413 Shutting down from deeply nested call stacks Requiring a *mut i8 as an input argument is a problem because our Rust code only has a reference to a jump buffer (e.g., &jmp_buf).2 The next few paragraphs work through the process of resolving this conflict. The jmp_buf type is defined like this: const JMP_BUF_WIDTH: usize =   mem::size_of::<usize>() * 8;     type jmp_buf = [i8; JMP_BUF_WIDTH]; The jmp_buf type is a type alias for an array of i8 that is as wide as 8 usize integers. The role of jmp_buf is to store the state of the program, such that the CPU’s registers can be repopulated when needed. There is only one jmp_buf value within listing 12.17, a global mutable static called RETURN_HERE, defined on line 14. The following exam- ple shows how jmp_buf is initialized: static mut RETURN_HERE: jmp_buf = [0; JMP_BUF_WIDTH]; How do we treat RETURN_HERE as a pointer? Within the Rust code, we refer to RETURN_ HERE as a reference (&RETURN_HERE). LLVM expects those bytes to be presented as a *mut i8. To perform the conversion, we apply four steps, which are all packed into a single line: unsafe { &RETURN_HERE as *const i8 as *mut i8 } Let’s explain what those four steps are: 1 Start with &RETURN_HERE, a read-only reference to a global static variable of type [i8; 8] on 64-bit machines or [i8; 4] on 32-bit machines. 2 Convert that reference to a *const i8. Casting between pointer types is consid- ered safe Rust, but deferencing that pointer requires an unsafe block. 3 Convert the *const i8 to a *mut i8. This declares the memory as mutable (read/write). 4 Wrap the conversion in an unsafe block because it deals with accessing a global variable. Why not use something like &mut RETURN_HERE as *mut i8? The Rust compiler becomes quite concerned about giving LLVM access to its data. The approach provided here, starting with a read-only reference, puts Rust at ease.  12.9.4 Compiling the sjlj project We’re now in a position where possible points of confusion about listing 12.17 should be minor. The following snippet again shows the behavior we’re attempting to replicate: 2 jmp_buf is the conventional name for this buffer, which might be useful for any readers who want to dive deeper themselves.

       "  'text': '417 Summary 12.10 A note on applying these techniques  to platforms without signals Signals are a “UNIX-ism.” On other platforms, messages from the OS are handled dif- ferently. On MS Windows, for example, command-line applications need to provide a handler function to the kernel via SetConsoleCtrlHandler. That handler function is then invoked when a signal is sent to the application.  Regardless of the specific mechanism, the high-level approach demonstrated in this chapter should be fairly portable. Here is the pattern: \\uf0a1Your CPU generates interrupts that require the OS to respond. \\uf0a1Operating systems often delegate responsibility for handling interrupts via some sort of callback system. \\uf0a1A callback system means creating a function pointer.  12.11 Revising exceptions At the start of the chapter, we discussed the distinction between signals, interrupts, and exceptions. There was little coverage of exceptions, directly. We have treated these as a special class of interrupts. Interrupts themselves have been modeled as signals.  To wrap up this chapter (and the book), we explored some of the features avail- able in rustc and LLVM. The bulk of this chapter utilized these features to work with signals. Within Linux, signals are the main mechanism that the OS uses to communi- cate with applications. On the Rust side, we have spent lots of time interacting with libc and unsafe blocks, unpacking function pointers, and tweaking global variables.  Summary \\uf0a1Hardware devices, such as the computer’s network card, notify applications about data that is ready to be processed by sending an interrupt to the CPU. \\uf0a1Function pointers are pointers that point to executable code rather than to data. These are denoted in Rust by the fn keyword. \\uf0a1Unix operating systems manage job control with two signals: SIGSTOP and SIGCONT. \\uf0a1Signal handlers do the least amount of work possible to mitigate the risk of trigger- ing race conditions caused when multiple signal handlers operate concurrently. A typical pattern is to set a flag with a global variable. That flag is periodically checked within the program’s main loop. \\uf0a1To create a global variable in Rust, create a “mutable static.” Accessing mutable statics requires an unsafe block. \\uf0a1The OS, signals, and the compiler can be utilized to implement exception han- dling in programming languages via the setjmp and longjmp syscalls. \\uf0a1Without the unsafe keyword, Rust programs would not be able to interface effectively with the OS and other third-party components.'},\n",

It  delivers the low-level power of C along with rock-solid  safety features that let you code fearlessly. Ideal for  applications requiring concurrency, Rust programs are com- pact, readable, and blazingly fast. Best of all, Rust’s famously  smart compiler helps you avoid even subtle coding errors. Rust in Action is a hands-on guide to systems programming  with Rust. Written for inquisitive programmers, it presents  real-world use cases that go far beyond syntax and structure.\\xa0  You’ll explore Rust implementations for fi le manipulation,  networking, and kernel-level programming and discover  awesome techniques for parallelism and concurrency. Along  the way, you’ll master Rust’s unique borrow checker model  for memory management without a garbage collector.  What’s Inside ● Elementary to advanced Rust programming ● Practical examples from systems programming ● Command-line, graphical and networked applications For intermediate programmers. No previous experience with  Rust required. Tim McNamara uses Rust to build data processing pipelines and  generative art. He is an expert in natural language processing  and data engineering.

But there are times when we need to pull in the reins. External systems often demand that our data matches their requirements.  Listing 11.13 provides an example of fitting the colors from the VGA-compatible text mode palette enum into a single u8. It removes any discretion from the compiler about which bit pattern (formally called the discriminant) to associate with particular variants. To prescribe a representation, add the repr attribute. You are then able to specify any integer type (i32, u8, i16, u16,…), as well as some special cases.  Using a prescribed representation has some disadvantages. In particular, it reduces your flexibility. It also prevents Rust from making space optimizations. Some enums, those with a single variant, require no representation. These appear in source code but occupy zero space in the running program.  11.5.3 Why use enums? You could model colors differently. For instance, it’s possible to create numeric con- stants that look identical in memory. The following shows one such possibility: const BLACK: u8 = 0x0; const BLUE: u8 = 0x1; // ... Using an enum adds an extra guard. It becomes much more difficult to use an illegal value in our code than if we were using an u8 directly. You will see this demonstrated when the Cursor struct is introduced in listing 11.17.  11.5.4 Creating a type that can print to the VGA frame buffer To print to the screen, we’ll use a Cursor struct that handles the raw memory manipu- lation and can convert between our Color type and what is expected by VGA. As the following listing shows, this type manages the interface between our code and the VGA frame buffer.

       "  'text': 'xv preface No one knows whether reading a technical book is going to be worth the effort. These books can be expensive, dull, and poorly written. Even worse, there’s a good chance that you won’t learn anything. Luckily, this book is written by someone who under- stands that.  This book’s first aim is to teach you Rust. Rust in Action presents large, working projects to promote your learning. Over the course of the book, you’ll write a data- base, a CPU emulator, an operating system kernel, and several other interesting proj- ects. You’ll even dabble with generative art. Each project is designed to enable you to explore the Rust programming language at your own pace. For those readers who know little Rust, there are many opportunities to expand the projects in whatever direction you choose.  There is more to learning a programming language than studying its syntax and semantics, however. You are also joining a community. Unfortunately, established communities can create invisible barriers for new entrants because of their shared knowledge, jargon, and practices.  One such barrier for many new Rust programmers is the concept of systems pro- gramming. Lots of programmers come to Rust without a background in that area. To compensate for this, Rust in Action has a second aim—to teach you systems pro- gramming. And, among other topics, you’ll learn about how memory, digital time- keeping, and device drivers work in the book’s 12 chapters. I hope this enables you to feel more comfortable when becoming a member of the Rust community. And we need you!',\n",

       "  'text': 'ABOUT THIS BOOK xx How this book is organized: A roadmap Rust in Action has two parts. The first introduces Rust’s syntax and some of its distinc- tive characteristics. The second part applies the knowledge gained in part one to sev- eral projects. In each chapter, one or two new Rust concepts are introduced. That said, part 1 provides a quick-fire introduction to Rust: ■ Chapter 1, “Introducing Rust,” explains why Rust exists and how to get started programming with it.  ■ Chapter 2, “Language foundations,” provides a solid base of Rust syntax. Exam- ples include a Mandelbrot set renderer and a grep clone. ■ Chapter 3, “Compound data types,” explains how to compose Rust data types and its error-handling facilities. ■ Chapter 4, “Lifetimes, ownership, and borrowing,” discusses the mechanisms for ensuring that accessing data is always valid. Part 2 applies Rust to introductory systems programming areas: ■ Chapter 5, “Data in Depth,” covers how information is represented in digital computers with a special emphasis on how numbers are approximated. Exam- ples include a bespoke number format and a CPU emulator. ■ Chapter 6, “Memory,” explains the terms references, pointers, virtual mem- ory, stack, and heap. Examples include a memory scanner and a generative art project. ■ Chapter 7, “Files and storage,” explains the process for storing data struc- tures into storage devices. Examples include a hex dump clone and a work- ing database. ■ Chapter 8, “Networking,” provides an explanation of how computers communi- cate by reimplementing HTTP multiple times, stripping away a layer of abstrac- tion each time. ■ Chapter 9, “Time and timekeeping,” explores the process for keeping track of time within a digital computer. Examples include a working NTP client. ■ Chapter 10, “Processes, threads, and containers,” explains processes, threads, and related abstractions. Examples include a turtle graphics application and a parallel parser. ■ Chapter 11, “Kernel,” describes the role of the operating system and how com- puters boot up. Examples include compiling your own bootloader and an oper- ating system kernel. ■ Chapter 12, “Signals, interrupts, and exceptions,” explains how the external world communicates with the CPU and operating systems.  The book is intended to be read linearly. Latter chapters assume knowledge taught in earlier ones. However, projects from each chapter are standalone. Therefore, you are welcome to jump backward and forward if there are topics that you would like to cover.',\n",

No special software is required outside of a working Rust installation. Installation instructions are provided in chapter 2.  This book contains many examples of source code both in numbered listings and inline with normal text. In both cases, source code is formatted in a fixed-width font, like this, to separate it from ordinary text. Sometimes code is also in bold to highlight code that has changed from the previous steps in the chapter, such as when a new feature is added to an existing line of code.  In many cases, the original source code has been reformatted; we’ve added line breaks and reworked indentation to accommodate the available page space in the book. In rare cases, even this was not enough, and listings include line-continuation markers (➥). Additionally, comments in the source code have often been removed from the listings when the code is described in the text. Code annotations accompany many of the listings, highlighting important concepts. liveBook discussion forum Purchase of Rust in Action includes free access to a private web forum run by Manning Publications where you can make comments about the book, ask technical questions, and receive help from the author and from other users: ■ To access the forum, go to https://livebook.manning.com/book/rust-in-action/ welcome/v-16/.  ■ You can also learn more about Manning’s forums and the rules of conduct at this location: https://livebook.manning.com/#!/discussion.

The title of the collection is LesFrançais peints par eux-mêmes, which translates as The French People Painted by Themselves. Each illustration is finely drawn and colored by hand, and the rich variety of drawing in the collection reminds us vividly of how culturally apart the world’s regions, towns, villages, and neighborhoods were just 200 years ago. Isolated from each other, people spoke different dialects and languages. In the streets or in the countryside, it was easy to identify where they lived and what their trade or station in life was just by their dress.  Dress codes have changed since then and the diversity by region, so rich at the time, has faded away. It is now hard to tell apart the inhabitants of different conti- nents, let alone different towns or regions. Perhaps we have traded cultural diversity for a more varied personal life—certainly for a more varied and fast-paced technolog- ical life.

I ran into a similar use case in one of my own projects—a vobsub     subtitle decoder, which parses complicated binary data, and which I     someday want to run as web service.  So obviously, I want to ensure     that there are no vulnerabilities in my code.     I wrote the code in Rust, and then I used \\'cargo fuzz\\' to try and     find vulnerabilities. After running a billion(!) fuzz iterations, I     found 5 bugs (see the \\'vobsub\\' section of the trophy case for a list     https:/ /github.com/rust-fuzz/trophy-case).     Happily, not _one_ of those bugs could actually be escalated into an     actual exploit. In each case, Rust\\'s various runtime checks     successfully caught the problem and turned it into a controlled panic.     (In practice, this would restart the web server cleanly.)     So my takeaway from this was that whenever I want a language (1) with     no GC, but (2) which I can trust in a security-critical context, Rust     is an excellent choice. The fact that I can statically link Linux     binaries (like with Go) is a nice plus.

This has been more or less our experience with fuzzing rust code in       firefox too, fwiw. Fuzzing found a lot of panics (and debug       assertions / \"safe\" overflow assertions). In one case it actually       found a bug that had been under the radar in the analogous Gecko       code for around a decade.

You have run your first Rust code without need- ing to write any Rust. Let’s take a look at what just happened.  Rust’s cargo tool provides both a build system and a package manager. That means cargo knows how to convert your Rust code into executable binaries and also can manage the process of downloading and compiling the project’s dependencies.  cargo new creates a project for you that follows a standard template. The tree command can reveal the default project structure and the files that are created after issuing cargo new: $ tree hello  hello ├── Cargo.toml └── src     └── main.rs 1 directory, 2 files All Rust projects created with cargo have the same structure. In the base directory, a file called Cargo.toml describes the project’s metadata, such as the project’s name, its version, and its dependencies. Source code appears in the src directory. Rust source code files use the .rs filename extension. To view the files that cargo new creates, use the tree command.  The next command that you executed was cargo run. This line is much simpler to grasp, but cargo actually did much more work than you realized. You asked cargo to run the project. As there was nothing to actually run when you invoked the command, it decided to compile the code in debug mode on your behalf to provide maximal error information. As it happens, the src/main.rs file always includes a “Hello, world!” stub. The result of that compilation was a file called hello (or hello.exe). The hello file was executed, and the result printed to your screen.  Executing cargo run has also added new files to the project. We now have a Cargo.lock file in the base of our project and a target/ directory. Both that file and the directory are managed by cargo. Because these are artifacts of the compilation process, we won’t need to touch these. Cargo.lock is a file that specifies the exact ver- sion numbers of all the dependencies so that future builds are reliably built the same way until Cargo.toml is modified.

Grüß Gott! ハロー・ワールド Let’s take a few moments to touch on some of the interesting elements of Rust from listing 1.2.  One of the first things that you are likely to notice is that strings in Rust are able to include a wide range of characters. Strings are guaranteed to be encoded as UTF-8. This means that you can use non-English languages with relative ease.  The one character that might look out of place is the exclamation mark after println. If you have programmed in Ruby, you may be used to thinking that it is used to signal a destructive operation. In Rust, it signals the use of a macro. Macros can be thought of as fancy functions for now. These offer the ability to avoid boilerplate code. In the case of println!, there is a lot of type detection going on under the hood so that arbitrary data types can be printed to the screen.  1.4 Downloading the book’s source code In order to follow along with the examples in this book, you might want to access the source code for the listings. For your convenience, source code for every example is available from two sources: \\uf0a1https://manning.com/books/rust-in-action \\uf0a1https://github.com/rust-in-action/code 1.5 What does Rust look and feel like? Rust is the programming language that allows Haskell and Java programmers to get along. Rust comes close to the high-level, expressive feel of dynamic languages like Haskell and Java while achieving low-level, bare-metal performance.  We looked at a few “Hello, world!” examples in section 1.3, so let’s try something slightly more complex to get a better feel for Rust’s features. Listing 1.2 provides a quick look at what Rust can do for basic text processing. The source code for this list- ing is in the ch1/ch1-penguins/src/main.rs file.

Macros are similar to functions except that instead of returning data, these return code. Macros are often used to simplify common patterns. eprintln! and println! both use a string literal with an embedded mini- language in their first argument to control their output.

The parse() method returns Ok(T) (where T stands for any type) when it can successfully parse the string; otherwise, it returns Err(E) (where E stands for an error type). The effect of if let Ok(T) is to skip any error cases like the one that’s encountered while processing the line Invalid,data. When Rust is unable to infer the types from the surrounding context, it will ask for you to specify those. The call to parse() includes an inline type annota- tion as parse::<f32>().

Rust’s distinguishing feature as a programming language is its ability to prevent invalid data access at compile time. Research projects by Microsoft’s Security Response Center and the Chromium browser project both suggest that issues relating to invalid data access account for approximately 70% of serious security bugs.13 Rust eliminates that class of bugs. It guarantees that your program is memory-safe without imposing any run- time costs.  Other languages can provide this level of safety, but these require adding checks that execute while your program is running, thus slowing it down. Rust manages to break out of this continuum, creating its own space as illustrated by figure 1.1.  Rust’s distinguishing feature as a professional community is its willingness to explicitly include values into its decision-making process. This ethos of inclusion is pervasive. Public messaging is welcoming. All interactions within the Rust community are governed by its code of conduct. Even the Rust compiler’s error messages are ridiculously helpful. 13 See the articles “We need a safer systems programming language,” http://mng.bz/VdN5 and “Memory safety,” http://mng.bz/xm7B for more information.',\n",

Listing 1.4 shows an example of a data race condition. If you remember, this condi- tion results from the inability to determine how a program behaves from run to run due to changing external factors. You’ll find this code in the ch1/ch1-race/src/ main.rs file.  1 use std::thread;       2 fn main() {  3     let mut data = 100;  4   5     thread::spawn(|| { data = 500; });      6     thread::spawn(|| { data = 1000; });     7     println!(\"{}\", data);  8 } If you are unfamiliar with the term thread, the upshot is that this code is not determin- istic. It’s impossible to know what value data will hold when main() exits. On lines 6 and 7 of the listing, two threads are created by calls to thread::spawn(). Each call takes a closure as an argument, denoted by vertical bars and curly braces (e.g., || {…}). The thread spawned on line 5 is attempting to set the data variable to 500, whereas the thread spawned on line 6 is attempting to set it to 1,000. Because the scheduling of threads is determined by the OS rather than the program, it’s impossible to know if the thread defined first will be the one that runs first.  Attempting to compile listing 1.5 results in a stampede of error messages. Rust does not allow multiple places in an application to have write access to data.

It offers generics, sophisticated data types, pattern matching, and closures.15 Those who have worked with other ahead-of-time compila- tion languages are likely to appreciate Rust’s build system and its comprehensive pack- age manager: cargo.  At first glance, we see that cargo is a front end for rustc, the Rust compiler, but cargo provides several additional utilities including the following: \\uf0a1 cargo new creates a skeleton Rust project in a new directory (cargo init uses the current directory). \\uf0a1 cargo build downloads dependencies and compiles the code. \\uf0a1 cargo run executes cargo build and then also runs the resulting executable file. \\uf0a1 cargo doc builds HTML documentation for every dependency in the current project.  1.6.3 Goal of Rust: Control Rust offers programmers fine-grained control over how data structures are laid out in memory and their access patterns. While Rust uses sensible defaults that align with its “zero cost abstractions” philosophy, those defaults do not suit all situations.  At times, it is imperative to manage your application’s performance. It might mat- ter to you that data is stored in the stack rather than on the heap. Perhaps, it might make sense to add reference counting to create a shared reference to a value. Occasion- ally, it might be useful to create one’s own type of pointer for a particular access pat- tern. The design space is large and Rust provides the tools to allow you to implement your preferred solution. NOTE If terms such as stack, heap, and reference counting are new, don’t put the book down! We’ll spend lots of time explaining these and how they work together throughout the rest of the book. Listing 1.7 prints the line a: 10, b: 20, c: 30, d: Mutex { data: 40 }. Each represen- tation is another way to store an integer. As we progress through the next few chap- ters, the trade-offs related to each level become apparent. For the moment, the important thing to remember is that the menu of types is comprehensive. You are wel- come to choose exactly what’s right for your specific use case.  Listing 1.7 also demonstrates multiple ways to create integers. Each form provides differing semantics and runtime characteristics. But programmers retain full control of the trade-offs that they want to make.     15 If these terms are unfamiliar, do keep reading. These are explained throughout the book. They are language features that you will miss in other languages.',\n",

C and C++ have much less consistency here, and building large projects with many dependencies is typically difficult. \\uf0a1Methods are always dispatched statically unless you explicitly request dynamic dispatch. This enables the compiler to heavily optimize code, sometimes to the point of eliminating the cost of a function call entirely.  1.7.2 Concurrency Asking a computer to do more than one thing at the same time has proven difficult for software engineers. As far as an OS is concerned, two independent threads of exe- cution are at liberty to destroy each other if a programmer makes a serious mistake. Yet Rust has spawned the expression fearless concurrency. Its emphasis on safety crosses the bounds of independent threads. There is no global interpreter lock (GIL) to con- strain a thread’s speed. We explore some of the implications of this in part 2.  1.7.3 Memory efficiency Rust enables you to create programs that require minimal memory. When needed, you can use fixed-size structures and know exactly how every byte is managed. High- level constructs, such as iteration and generic types, incur minimal runtime overhead.  1.8 Downsides of Rust It’s easy to talk about this language as if it is the panacea for all software engineering. For example \\uf0a1“A high-level syntax with low-level performance!” \\uf0a1“Concurrency without crashes!” \\uf0a1“C with perfect safety!” These slogans (sometimes overstated) are great. But for all of its merits, Rust does have some disadvantages. 1.8.1 Cyclic data structures In Rust, it is difficult to model cyclic data like an arbitrary graph structure. Imple- menting a doubly-linked list is an undergraduate-level computer science problem. Yet Rust’s safety checks do hamper progress here. If you’re new to the language, avoid implementing these sorts of data structures until you’re more familiar with Rust.  1.8.2 Compile times Rust is slower at compiling code than its peer languages. It has a complex compiler toolchain that receives multiple intermediate representations and sends lots of code to the LLVM compiler. The unit of compilation for a Rust program is not an individ- ual file but a whole package (known affectionately as a crate). As crates can include',\n",

Although this enables whole-of-crate optimization, it requires whole-of-crate compilation as well.  1.8.3 Strictness It’s impossible—well, difficult—to be lazy when programming with Rust. Programs won’t compile until everything is just right. The compiler is strict, but helpful.  Over time, it’s likely that you’ll come to appreciate this feature. If you’ve ever pro- grammed in a dynamic language, then you may have encountered the frustration of your program crashing because of a misnamed variable. Rust brings that frustration forward so that your users don’t have to experience the frustration of things crashing.  1.8.4 Size of the language Rust is large! It has a rich type system, several dozen keywords, and includes some fea- tures that are unavailable in other languages. These factors all combine to create a steep learning curve. To make this manageable, I encourage learning Rust gradually. Start with a minimal subset of the language and give yourself time to learn the details when you need these. That is the approach taken in this book. Advanced concepts are deferred until much later.  1.8.5 Hype The Rust community is wary of growing too quickly and being consumed by hype. Yet, a number of software projects have encountered this question in their Inbox: “Have you considered rewriting this in Rust?” Unfortunately, software written in Rust is still software. It not immune to security problems and does not offer a panacea to all of software engineering’s ills.  1.9 TLS security case studies To demonstrate that Rust will not alleviate all errors, let’s examine two serious exploits that threatened almost all internet-facing devices and consider whether Rust would have prevented those.  By 2015, as Rust gained prominence, implementations of SSL/TLS (namely, OpenSSL and Apple’s own fork) were found to have serious security holes. Known informally as Heartbleed and goto fail;, both exploits provide opportunities to test Rust’s claims of memory safety. Rust is likely to have helped in both cases, but it is still possi- ble to write Rust code that suffers from similar issues. 1.9.1 Heartbleed Heartbleed, officially designated as CVE-2014-0160,16 was caused by re-using a buffer incorrectly. A buffer is a space set aside in memory for receiving input. Data can leak from one read to the next if the buffer’s contents are not cleared between writes. 16 See “CVE-2014-0160 Detail,” https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-0160.',\n",

This compilation method avoids depending on shared libraries that you must install before the pro- gram can run.

Programmers bene- fit from control over memory use and fast startup times. As of mid-2017, Rust touts the world’s fastest regular expression engine.

Rust also underlies the implementation of multiple search engines, data-processing engines, and log-parsing systems. Its type system and memory control provide you with the ability to create high throughput data pipelines with a low and stable memory footprint. Small filter programs can be easily embedded into the larger framework via Apache Storm, Apache Kafka, or Apache Hadoop streaming.  1.10.3 Extending applications Rust is well suited for extending programs written in a dynamic language.

This is generally intended for applications written in C++, such as games, to be able to be deployed to people’s phones. Rust is able to talk to the phone via the same interface with no additional runtime cost.  22 See “Community makes Rust an easy choice for npm: The npm Registry uses Rust for its CPU-bound bottle- necks,” http://mng.bz/xm9B. 23 See “Of tantivy’s indexing,” https://fulmicoton.com/posts/behold-tantivy-part2/.',\n",

That is the magic of a programming language. This chapter’s aim is to allow you to become familiar with the process of converting Rust source code into a running program.  Understanding this process is more fun than it sounds! And it sets you up for an exciting learning journey. By the end of chapter 4, you will have implemented a vir- tual CPU that can also interpret programs that you create. 2.1.1 Compiling single files with rustc Listing 2.1 is a short, yet complete Rust program. To translate it into a working pro- gram, we use software called a compiler. The compiler’s role is to translate the source code into machine code, as well as take care of lots of bookkeeping to satisfy the oper- ating system (OS) and CPU that it is a runnable program. The Rust compiler is called rustc. You’ll find the source code for listing 2.1 in the file ch2/ok.rs.  1 fn main() {  2   println!(\"OK\")  3 } To compile a single file written in Rust into a working program 1 Save your source code to a file. In our case, we’ll use the filename ok.rs. 2 Make sure that the source code includes a main() function. 3 Open a shell window such as Terminal, cmd.exe, Powershell, bash, zsh, or any other. 4 Execute the command rustc <file>, where <file> is the file you want to compile. When compilation succeeds, rustc sends no output to the console. Behind the scenes, rustc has dutifully created an executable, using the input filename to choose the out- put filename.  Assuming that you’ve saved listing 2.1 to a file called ok.rs, let’s see what that looks like. The following snippet provides a short demonstration of the process: $ rustc ok.rs  $ ./ok         OK 2.1.2 Compiling Rust projects with cargo Most Rust projects are larger than a single file. These typically include dependencies. To prepare ourselves for that, we’ll use a higher-level tool than rustc, called cargo. cargo understands how to drive rustc (and much more).

Listing 2.2 prints a + b = 30 to the con- sole. As you can see from lines 2–5 in the listing, there are multiple syntactic choices for annotating data types to integers. Use whichever feels most natural for the situa- tion at hand. The source code for this listing is in ch2/ch2-first-steps.rs.  1 fn main() {      2   let a = 10;       3   let b: i32 = 20;       4   let c = 30i32;         5   let d = 30_i32;             6   let e = add(add(a, b), add(c, d));  7   8   println!(\"( a + b ) + ( c + d ) = {}\", e);  9 } 10  11 fn add(i: i32, j: i32) -> i32 {     12   i + j      13 } NOTE In the listing, be careful about adding a semicolon to the add() function declaration. This changes the semantics, returning () (unit) rather than i32. Although there are only 13 lines of code, there is quite a lot packed into listing 2.2. Here’s a brief description that should provide the gist of what’s going on. We will cover the details in the rest of the chapter.  In line 1 (fn main() {), the fn keyword begins a function definition. The entry point to all Rust programs is main(). It takes no arguments and returns no value.1 Code blocks, also known as lexical scopes, are defined with curly braces: { and }.  In line 2 (let a = 10;), we use let to declare variable bindings. Variables are immutable by default, meaning that they are read-only rather than read-write. And finally, statements are delimited with semicolons (;).  In line 3 (let b: i32 = 20;), you can designate a specific data type for the com- piler. At times, this will be required as the compiler will be unable to deduce a unique type on your behalf.  In line 4 (let c = 30i32;), you’ll note that Rust’s numeric literals can include types annotations. This can be helpful when navigating complex numerical expressions. And Listing 2.2 Adding integers using variables and declaring types 1 This isn’t technically correct, but is accurate enough for now. If you’re an experienced Rust programmer skim- ming through this chapter, you’ll know that main() returns () (unit) by default and can also return a Result. Rust is flexible with the location of the main() function. Types can be inferred  by the compiler… …or declared by the programmer  when creating variables. Numeric types can include a type  annotation in their literal form. Numbers can include underscores,  which are intended to increase  readability and have no functional  impact. Type declarations are required  when defining functions. Functions return the last  expression’s result so that  return is not required.',\n",

These increase readability but are insignificant to the compiler. In line 6 (let e = add(add(a, b), add(c, d));), it should be easy to see that calling func- tions looks like what you’ve experienced in most other programming languages.  In line 8 (println!(\"( a + b ) + ( c + d ) = {}\", e); ), println!() is a macro, which is function-like but returns code rather than values. When printing to the con- sole, every input data type has its own way of being represented as a text string. println!() takes care of figuring out the exact methods to call on its arguments.  Strings use double quotes (\") rather than single quotes (\\'). Rust uses single quotes for single characters, which are a distinct type, char. And with Rust, string formatting uses {} as a placeholder, rather than the C-like printf style of %s or other variants.  Finally, in line 10 (fn add(…) -> i32 {), you can see that Rust’s syntax for defining functions is similar to those programming languages that use explicit type declara- tions. Commas delimit parameters, and type declarations follow variable names. The dagger (->) or thin arrow syntax indicates the return type.  2.3 Numbers Computers have been associated with numbers for longer than you have been able to say “formula translator.” This section discusses how to create numeric types in Rust and how to perform operations on these. 2.3.1 Integers and decimal (floating-point) numbers Rust uses a relatively conventional syntax for creating integers (1, 2, …) and floating- point numbers (1.0, 1.1, …). Operations on numbers use infix notation, meaning that numeric expressions look like those that you’re used to seeing in most programming lan- guages. To operate on multiple types, Rust also allows the same token (+) for addition. This is called operator overloading. Some notable differences from other languages follow: \\uf0a1Rust includes a large number of numeric types. You will become used to declaring the size in bytes, which affects how many numbers the type can represent and whether your type is able to represent negative numbers. \\uf0a1Conversions between types are always explicit. Rust does not automatically convert your 16-bit integer into a 32-bit integer. \\uf0a1Rust’s numbers can have methods. For example, to round 24.5 to the nearest inte- ger, Rust programmers use 24.5_f32.round() rather than (round(24.5_f32)). Here, the type suffix is required because a concrete type is necessary. To start, let’s consider a small example. You’ll find the code in ch2/ch2-intro-to- numbers.rs in the examples for this book.

The types are grouped into a few families: \\uf0a1Signed integers (i) represent negative as well as positive integers. \\uf0a1Unsigned integers (u) only represent positive integers but can go twice as high as their signed counterparts. \\uf0a1Floating-point types (f) represent real numbers with special bit patterns to rep- resent infinity, negative infinity, and “not a number” values. Integer width is the number of bits that the type uses in RAM and in the CPU. Types that take up more space, such as u32 vs. i8, can represent a wider range of numbers. But this incurs the expense of needing to store extra zeros for smaller numbers, as table 2.2 shows. Although we’ve only touched on numbers, we nearly have enough exposure to Rust to create a prototype of our pattern-matching program. But let’s look at comparing numbers before we create our program.  2.3.3 Comparing numbers Rust’s numeric types support a large suite of comparisons that you’re probably famil- iar with. Enabling support for these comparisons is provided by a feature that you have not encountered yet. It is called traits.2 Table 2.3 summarizes the comparison operators available to you. Table 2.1 Rust types for representing scalar (single) numbers i8, i16, i32, i64 Signed integers ranging from 8 bit to 64 bit. u8, u16, u32, u64 Unsigned integers ranging from 8 bit to 64 bit. f32, f64 Floating-point numbers in 32-bit and 64-bit variants. isize, usize Integers that assume the CPU’s “native” width. For example, in 64-bit CPUs,  usize and isize will be 64-bits wide. Table 2.2 Multiple bit patterns can represent the same number.

On line 1, the use keyword brings the std::convert::TryInto trait into local scope. This unlocks the try_into() method of the b variable. We’ll bypass a full explanation of why this occurs for now. In the meantime, consider a trait as a collection of methods. If you are from an object-oriented background, traits can be thought of as abstract classes or inter- faces. If your programming experience is in functional languages, you can think of traits as type classes.  Line 7 provides a glimpse of error handling in Rust. b.try_into() returns an i32 value wrapped within a Result. Result is introduced properly in chapter 3. It can contain either a success value or an error value. The unwrap() method can handle the success value and returns the value of b as an i32 here. If the conversion between u16 and i32 were to fail, then calling unsafe() would crash the program. As the book progresses, you will learn safer ways of dealing with Result rather than risking the program’s stability!  A distinguishing characteristic of Rust is that it only allows a type’s methods to be called when the trait is within local scope. An implicit prelude enables common oper- ations such as addition and assignment to be used without explicit imports.

Representing all of the reals would require infinite precision. \\uf0a1These can represent values that have unintuitive semantics. Unlike integers, floating-point types have some values that do not play well together (by design). Formally, these only have a partial equivalence relation. This is encoded in Rust’s type system. f32 and f64 types only implement the std::cmp::PartialEq trait, whereas other numeric types also implement std::cmp::Eq. To prevent these hazards, here are two guidelines to follow: \\uf0a1Avoid testing floating-point numbers for equality. \\uf0a1Be wary when results may be mathematically undefined. Using equality to compare floating-point numbers can be highly problematic. Floating- point numbers are implemented by computing systems that use binary (base 2) math- ematics, but are often asked to perform operations on decimal (base 10) numbers. This poses a problem because many values we care about, such as 0.1, have no exact representation in binary.a To illustrate the problem, consider the following snippet. Should it run successfully, or should it crash? Although the expression that is being evaluated (0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3) is a mathematical tautology, it crashes on most systems that run it: fn main() {   assert!(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);    } But not all. It turns out that the data type can affect whether the program succeeds or fails. The following code, available at ch2/ch2-add-floats.rs, interrogates the inter- nal bit patterns of each value to find where the differences lie. It then performs the test in the previous example against both f32 and f64 types. Only one test passes:  1 fn main() {  2     let abc: (f32, f32, f32) = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3);  3     let xyz: (f64, f64, f64) = (0.1, 0.2, 0.3);  4   5     println!(\"abc (f32)\");  6     println!(\"   0.1 + 0.2: {:x}\", (abc.0 + abc.1).to_bits());  7     println!(\"         0.3: {:x}\", (abc.2).to_bits());  8     println!();  9  10     println!(\"xyz (f64)\"); 11     println!(\"   0.1 + 0.2: {:x}\", (xyz.0 + xyz.1).to_bits()); 12     println!(\"         0.3: {:x}\", (xyz.2).to_bits()); 13     println!(); 14  15     assert!(abc.0 + abc.1 == abc.2);    16     assert!(xyz.0 + xyz.1 == xyz.2);     17 } assert! crashes the program  unless its argument evaluates  to true.

Other languages allow special values such as 0 or an empty string to stand in for false and for other values to represent true, but Rust doesn’t allow this. The only value that can be used for true is true, and for false, use false. Rust is an expression-based language In programming languages from this heritage, all expressions return values and almost everything is an expression. This heritage reveals itself through some con- structs that are not legal in other languages. In idiomatic Rust, the return keyword is omitted from functions as shown in the following snippet: fn is_even(n: i32) -> bool {   n % 2 == 0 } For example, Rust programmers assign variables from conditional expressions: fn main() {   let n = 123456;   let description = if is_even(n) {     \"even\"   } else {     \"odd\"   };   println!(\"{} is {}\", n, description);    } This can be extended to other blocks including match like this: fn main() {   let n = 654321;   let description = match is_even(n) {     true => \"even\",     false => \"odd\",   };   println!(\"{} is {}\", n, description);     } Perhaps most surprisingly, the break keyword also returns a value. This can be used to allow “infinite” loops to return values: fn main() {   let n = loop {       break 123;   };   println!(\"{}\", n);    } Prints \"123456  is even\" Prints \"654321  is odd\" Prints \"123\"',\n",

Many control structures (like looping) are defined in terms of match under the hood. These really shine when combined with the Option type that’s discussed in depth in the next chapter.  Now that we have taken a good look at defining numbers and working with some of Rust’s flow control mechanisms, let’s move on to adding structure to programs with functions.  2.5 Defining functions Looking back to where the chapter begins, the snippet in listing 2.2 contained a small function, add(). add takes two i32 values and returns their sum. The following listing repeats the function. 10 fn add(i: i32, j: i32) -> i32 {     11   i + j 12 } For the moment, let’s concentrate on the syntax of each of the elements in listing 2.9. Figure 2.2 provides a visual picture of each of the pieces. Anyone who has pro- grammed in a strongly-typed programming language should be able to squint their way through the diagram.  Rust’s functions require that you specify your parameter’s types and the function’s return type. This is the foundational knowledge that we’ll need for the majority of our work with Rust. Let’s put it to use with our first non-trivial program.

It can be difficult to form a mental picture of what is happening. That makes it difficult to understand which symbols to put where. Thankfully, the Rust compiler is a good coach.  A reference is a value that stands in place for another value. For example, imagine that variable a is a large array that is costly to duplicate. In some sense, a reference r is a cheap copy of a. But instead of creating a duplicate, the program stores a’s address in memory. When the data from a is required, r can be dereferenced to make a available. The following listing shows the code for this. fn main() {   let a = 42;   let r = &a;       let b = a + *r;           println!(\"a + a = {}\", b);    } References are created with the reference operator (&) and dereferencing occurs with the dereference operator (*). These operators act as unary operators, meaning that these only take one operand. One of the limitations of source code written in ASCII text is that multiplication and dereferencing use the same symbol. Let’s see these in use as part of a larger example.  Listing 2.11 searches for a number (the needle defined on line 2) within an array of numbers (the haystack defined on line 3). The code then prints 42 to the console when compiled.

The following bullet points break line 1 of the previous snippet into its parts: \\uf0a1 fn add_with_lifetimes(...) -> i32 should be familiar to you already. From this we can infer that add_with_lifetimes() is a function that returns an i32 value. \\uf0a1 <\\'a, \\'b> declares two lifetime variables, \\'a and \\'b, within the scope of add_with_lifetimes(). These are normally spoken as lifetime a and lifetime b. \\uf0a1 i: &\\'a i32 binds lifetime variable \\'a to the lifetime of i. The syntax reads as “parameter i is a reference to an i32 with lifetime a.” \\uf0a1 j: &\\'b i32 binds the lifetime variable \\'b to the lifetime of j. The syntax reads as “parameter j is a reference to an i32 with lifetime b.” The significance of binding a lifetime variable to a value probably isn’t obvious. Underpinning Rust’s safety checks is a lifetime system that verifies that all attempts to access data are valid. Lifetime annotations allow programmers to declare their intent. All values bound to a given lifetime must live as long as the last access to any value bound to that lifetime.  The lifetime system usually works unaided. Although every parameter has a life- time, these checks are typically invisible as the compiler can infer most lifetimes by itself.6 But the compiler needs assistance in difficult cases. Functions that accept multi- ple references as arguments or return a reference are often when the compiler will request assistance via an error message.  No lifetime annotations are required when calling a function. When used in a complete example as in the next listing, you can see lifetime annotations at the func- tion definition (line 1), but not when it’s used (line 8). The source code for the listing is in ch2-add-with-lifetimes.rs.  1 fn add_with_lifetimes<\\'a, \\'b>(i: &\\'a i32, j: &\\'b i32) -> i32 {  2   *i + *j       3 }  4   5 fn main() {  6   let a = 10;  7   let b = 20;  8   let res = add_with_lifetimes(&a, &b);      9  10   println!(\"{}\", res); 11 } On line 2, *i + *j adds together the referent values held by the i and j variables. It’s common to see lifetime parameters when using references. While Rust can infer lifetimes 6 Omitting lifetime annotations is formally referred to as lifetime elision. Listing 2.14 Type signature of a function with lifetime explicit annotations Adds the values referred to by  i and j rather than adding the  references directly &10 and &20 mean reference  10 and 20, respectively.

NOTE Lifetime parameters are a way of providing control to the programmer while maintaining high-level code.  2.8.2 Generic functions Another special case of function syntax appears when programmers write Rust func- tions to handle many possible input types. So far, we have seen functions that accept 32-bit integers (i32). The following listing shows a function signature that can be called by many input types as long as these are all the same. fn add<T>(i: T, j: T) -> T {       i + j } Capital letters in place of a type indicate a generic type. Conventionally, the variables T, U, and V are used as placeholder values, but this is arbitrary. E is often used to denote an error type. We’ll look at error handling in detail in chapter 3.  Generics enable significant code reuse and can greatly increase the usability of a strongly-typed language. Unfortunately, listing 2.15 doesn’t compile as is. The Rust compiler complains that it cannot add two values of any type T together.

All of Rust’s operators, including addition, are defined within traits. To require that type T must support addition, we include a trait bound alongside the type variable in the function’s definition. The following listing gives an example of this syntax. fn add<T: std::ops::Add<Output = T>>(i: T, j: T) -> T  {   i + j } The fragment <T: std::ops::Add<Output = T>> says that T must implement std::ops::Add. Using a single type variable T with the trait bound ensures that argu- ments i and j, as well as the result type, are the same type and that their type supports addition.  What is a trait? A trait is a language feature that is analogous to an interface, proto- col, or contract. If you have a background in object-oriented programming, consider a trait to be an abstract base class. If you have a background in functional program- ming, Rust’s traits are close to Haskell’s type classes. For now, it’s enough to say that traits enable types to advertise that they are using common behavior.  All of Rust’s operations are defined with traits. For example, the addition operator (+) is defined as the std::ops::Add trait. Traits are properly introduced in chapter 3 and are progressively explained in depth during the course of the book.  To reiterate: all of Rust’s operators are syntactic sugar for a trait’s methods. Rust supports operator overloading this way. During the compilation process, a + b is con- verted to a.add(b).  Listing 2.17 is a full example that demonstrates that generic functions can be called by multiple types. The listing prints these three lines to the console: 4.6 30 15s Listing 2.16 Type signature of a generic function with trait bounds All types Types that support addition by implementing std::ops::Add Figure 2.3 Only a subset of types have  implement operators.

Some features of list- ing 2.18 that are worth highlighting include the following. From here, we’ll expand the functionality of our proto-application: \\uf0a1Line 9 (quote.lines()) demonstrates iterating line-by-line in a platform- independent manner. \\uf0a1Line 10 (line.contains()) demonstrates searching for text using the method syntax. Navigating Rust’s rich collection of string types Strings are complicated for newcomers to Rust. Implementation details tend to bubble up from below and make comprehension difficult. How computers represent text is complicated, and Rust chooses to expose some of that complexity. This enables programmers to have full control but does place a burden on those learning the language. String and &str both represent text, yet are distinct types. Interacting with values from both types can be an annoying exercise at first as different methods are required to perform similar actions. Prepare yourself for irritating type errors as your intuition develops. Until that intuition develops, however, you will usually have fewer issues if you convert your data to the String type. A String is (probably) closest to what you know as a string type from other lan- guages. It supports familiar operations such as concatenation (joining two strings together), appending new text onto an existing string, and trimming whitespace. str is a high-performance, relatively feature-poor type. Once created, str values can- not expand or shrink. In this sense, these are similar to interacting with a raw memory array. Unlike a raw memory array, though, str values are guaranteed to be valid UTF-8 characters. str is usually seen in this form: &str. A &str (pronounced string slice) is a small type that contains a reference to str data and a length. Attempting to assign a variable to type str will fail. The Rust compiler wants to create fixed-sized variables within a function’s stack frame. As str values can be of arbitrary length, these can only be stored as local variables by reference. Multilined strings do not  require special syntax.  The \\\\ character on line 3  escapes the new line. lines() returns an iterator over quote  where each iteration is a line of text. Rust  uses each operating system’s conventions  on what constitutes a new line.',\n",

Adding a few lines to our previous example, we now see the following line printed to the screen. Listing 2.19 shows the code that adds this functionality, which you’ll find in ch2/ch2-simple-with-linenums.rs: 2: dark square is a picture feverishly turned--in search of what? (continued) For those readers that have prior experience with systems programming, String uses dynamic memory allocation to store the text that it represents. Creating &str values avoids a memory allocation. String is an owned type. Ownership has a particular meaning within Rust. An owner is able to make any changes to the data and is responsible for deleting values that it owns when it leaves scope (this is fully explained in chapter 3). A &str is a bor- rowed type. In practical terms, this means that &str can be thought of as read-only data, whereas String is read-write. String literals (e.g., \"Rust in Action\") have the type &str. The full type signature including the lifetime parameter is &\\'static str. The \\'static lifetime is somewhat special. It too owes its name to implementation details. Executable programs can contain a section of memory that is hard-coded with values. That section is known as static memory because it is read-only during execution. Some other types may be encountered in your travels. Here’s a short list:a \\uf0a1 char—A single character encoded as 4 bytes. The internal representation of char is equivalent to UCS-4/UTF-32. This differs from &str and String, which encodes single characters as UTF-8. Conversion does impose a pen- alty, but it means that char values are of fixed-width and are, therefore, eas- ier for the compiler to reason about. Characters encoded as UTF-8 can span 1 to 4 bytes. \\uf0a1 [u8]—A slice of raw bytes, usually found when dealing with streams of binary data. \\uf0a1 Vec<u8>—A vector of raw bytes, usually created when consuming [u8] data. String is to Vec<u8> as str is to [u8]. \\uf0a1 std::ffi::OSString—A platform-native string. It’s behavior is close to String but without a guarantee that it’s encoded as UTF-8 and that it won’t contain the zero byte (0x00). \\uf0a1 std::path::Path—A string-like type that is dedicated to handling filesys- tem paths. Fully understanding the distinction between String and &str requires knowledge of arrays and vectors. Textual data is similar to these two types with added convenience methods applied over the top. a Unfortunately, this is not an exhaustive list.

In the GNU grep implementation, this is the -C NUM switch.

The goal of this section is to support printing out n lines of context that sur- round a match. To get there, we need to segue somewhat and explain more fully arrays, slices, and vectors. The most useful type for this exercise is the vector. To learn about vectors, though, we need to start by learning about its two simpler cous- ins: arrays and slices. 2.10.1 Arrays An array, at least as far as Rust is concerned, is a tightly-packed collection of the same thing. It’s possible to replace items within an array, but its size cannot change. Because variable-length types like String add a degree of complication, we’ll revert back to dis- cussing numbers for a little while.  Creating arrays takes two forms. We can provide a comma-delimited list within square brackets (for example, [1, 2, 3]) or a repeat expression, where you furnish two values delimited by a semicolon (for example, [0; 100]). The value on the left (0) is repeated by the number of times on the right (100). Listing 2.21 shows each varia- tion on lines 2–5. The source code for this listing is in the ch2-3arrays.rs file.

These are a con- tiguous block of memory with elements of a uniform type. The simplicity is still some- what deceptive. Arrays can cause a few learning difficulties for newcomers: \\uf0a1The notation can be confusing.[T; n] describes an array’s type, where T is the ele- ments’ type and n is a non-negative integer. [f32; 12] denotes an array of 12 32-bit floating-point numbers. It’s easy to get confused with slices [T], which do not have a compile-time length. \\uf0a1 [u8; 3] is a different type than [u8; 4]. The size of the array matters to the type system. \\uf0a1In practice, most interaction with arrays occurs via another type called a slice ([T]). The slice is itself interacted with by reference (&[T]). And to add some linguistic confusion into the mix, both slices and references to slices are called slices. Rust maintains its focus on safety. Array indexing is bounds checked. Requesting an item that’s out of bounds crashes (panics in Rust terminology) the program rather than returning erroneous data.  2.10.2 Slices Slices are dynamically sized array-like objects. The term dynamically sized means that their size is not known at compile time. Yet, like arrays, these don’t expand or contract. The use of the word dynamic in dynamically sized is closer in meaning to dynamic typing rather than movement. The lack of compile-time knowledge explains the distinction in the type signature between an array ([T; n]) and a slice ([T]).  Slices are important because it’s easier to implement traits for slices than arrays. Traits are how Rust programmers add methods to objects. As [T; 1], [T; 2], …, [T; n] are all different types, implementing traits for arrays can become unwieldy. Creating a slice from an array is easy and cheap because it doesn’t need to be tied to any spe- cific size.  Another important use for slices is their ability to act as a view on arrays (and other slices). The term view here is taken from database technology and means that slices can gain fast, read-only access to data without needing to copy anything around.  The problem with slices is that Rust wants to know the size of every object in your program, and slices are defined as not having a compile-time size. References to the rescue. As mentioned in the discussion about the use of the term dynamically sized, slice size is fixed in memory. These are made up of two usize components (a pointer and a length). That’s why you typically see slices referred to in their referenced form, &[T] (like string slices that take the notation &str). NOTE Don’t worry too much about the distinctions between arrays and slices yet. In practice, it’s not material. Each term is an artifact of implementation details. Those implementation details are important when dealing with performance-critical code but not when learning the basics of the language.',\n",

When we are, adds  that line to the  relevant Vec<T>  within ctx. saturating_sub() is  subtraction that returns  0 on integer underflow  rather than crashing the  program (CPUs don’t like  attempting to send usize  below zero). Copies line into a new  String and stores that  locally for each match ref line informs the compiler  that we want to borrow this  value rather than move it.

The regex crate provides the ability to match regular expressions rather than simply looking for exact matches.  To use third-party code, we’ll rely on the cargo command-line tool. Follow these instructions: 1 Open a command prompt. 2 Move to a scratch directory with cd /tmp (cd %TMP% on MS Windows). 3 Run cargo new grep-lite --vcs none. It produces a short confirmation message: Created binary (application) `grep-lite` package 4 Run cd grep-lite to move into the project directory. 5 Execute cargo add regex@1 to add version 1 of the regex crate as a dependency. This alters the file /tmp/grep-lite/Cargo.toml. If cargo add is unavailable for you, see the sidebar, “2.2,” in section 2.3.4. 6 Run cargo build. You should see output fairly similar to the following begin to appear:   Updating crates.io index Downloaded regex v1.3.6  Compiling lazy_static v1.4.0  Compiling regex-syntax v0.6.17  Compiling thread_local v1.0.1  Compiling aho-corasick v0.7.10  Compiling regex v1.3.6  Compiling grep-lite v0.1.0 (/tmp/grep-lite)   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 4.47s Now that you have the crate installed and compiled, let’s put it into action. First, we’ll support searching for exact matches in listing 2.23. Later, in listing 2.26, the project grows to support regular expressions. 2.11.1 Adding support for regular expressions Regular expressions add great flexibility to the patterns that we are able to search for.

Lastly, we take a deeper look at traits, Rust’s system for defining interfaces.  Throughout this chapter, you’ll work through how to represent files in code. Although conceptually simple—if you’re reading this book, it’s highly likely you’ve interacted with a file through code before—there are enough edge cases to make things interesting. Our strategy will be to create a mock version of everything using our own imaginary API. Then, toward the latter part of the chapter, you’ll learn how to interact with your actual operating system (OS) and its filesystem(s). 3.1 Using plain functions to experiment with an API To start, let’s see how far we can get by making use of the tools we already know. List- ing 3.1 lays out a few things that we would expect, such as opening and closing a file. We’ll use a rudimentary mock type to model one: a simple alias around String that holds a filename and little else.  To make things slightly more interesting than writing lots of boilerplate code, list- ing 3.1 sprinkles in a few new concepts. These show you how to tame the compiler while you’re experimenting with your design. It provides attributes (#![allow(unused _variables)]) to relax compiler warnings. The read function illustrates how to define a function that never returns. The code actually doesn’t do anything, however. That will come shortly.

Brace yourself for a few sce- nic detours along the way as we encounter a few side roads that will be profitable to explore. Special return types in Rust If you are new to the language, some return types are difficult to interpret. These are also especially difficult to search for because they are made from symbols rather than words. Known as the unit type, () formally is a zero-length tuple. It is used to express that a function returns no value. Functions that appear to have no return type return (), and expressions that are terminated with a semicolon (;) return (). For example, the report() function in the following code block returns the unit type implicitly: use std::fmt::Debug; fn report<T: Debug>(item: T) {      println!(\"{:?}\", item);        } And this example returns the unit type explicitly: fn clear(text: &mut String) -> () {   *text = String::from(\"\");         } The unit type often occurs in error messages. It’s common to forget that the last expression of a function shouldn’t end with a semicolon. The exclamation symbol, !, is known as the “Never” type. Never indicates that a function never returns, especially when it is guaranteed to crash. For example, take this code: fn dead_end() -> ! {   panic!(\"you have reached a dead end\");    } item can be any type  that implements  std::fmt::Debug. {:?} directs the println! macro to  use std::fmt::Debug to convert  item to a printable string. Replaces the string at text  with an empty string The panic! macro causes the  program to crash. This means  the function is guaranteed  never to return.',\n",

Explicit lifetimes are required when a field is a reference to another object. \\uf0a1Lines 8–11 create our first instance of File. We use a literal syntax here, but typi- cally structs in the wild are created via a convenience method. String::from() is one of those convenience methods. It takes a value of another type; in this case, a string slice (&str), which returns a String instance. Vec::new() is the more common case. \\uf0a1Lines 13–17 demonstrate accessing our new instance’s fields. We prepend an amper- sand to indicate that we want to access this data by reference. In Rust parlance, this means that the variables f1_name and f1_length are borrowing the data these refer to. You have probably noticed that our File struct doesn’t actually store anything to disk at all. That’s actually OK for now. If you’re interested, figure 3.1 shows its internals. In the figure, its two fields (name and data) are themselves both created by structs. If you’re unfamiliar with the term pointer (ptr), consider pointers to be the same thing as references for now. Pointers are variables that refer to some location in memory. The details are explained at length in chapter 6. We’ll leave interacting with the hard disk drive or other persistent storage until later in the chapter. For the meantime, let’s recreate listing 3.1 and add the File type as promised. The newtype pattern Sometimes the type keyword is all that you need. But what about when you need the compiler to treat your new “type” as a fully-fledged, distinct type rather than just an alias? Enter newtype. The newtype pattern consists of wrapping a core type within a single field struct (or perhaps a tuple). The following code shows how to distin- guish network hostnames from ordinary strings.

Methods are functions that are coupled to some object. From a syntactic point of view, these are just functions that don’t need to specify one of their argu- ments. Rather than calling open() and passing a File object in as an argument (read(f, buffer)), methods allow the main object to be implicit in the function call (f.read(buffer)) using the dot operator.1  Rust is different than other languages that support methods: there is no class key- word. Types created with struct (and enum, which is described later) feel like classes at times, but as they don’t support inheritance, it’s probably a good thing that they’re named something different.  To define methods, Rust programmers use an impl block, which is physically dis- tinct in source code from the struct and enum blocks that you have already encoun- tered. Figure 3.2 shows the differences. 3.3.1 Simplifying object creation by implementing new() Creating objects with reasonable defaults is done through the new() method. Every struct can be instantiated through a literal syntax. This is handy for getting started, but leads to unnecessary verbosity in most code.  Using new() is a convention within the Rust community. Unlike other languages, new is not a keyword and isn’t given some sort of blessed status above other methods. Table 3.1 summarizes the conventions. 1 There are a number of theoretical differences between methods and functions, but a detailed discussion of those computer science topics is available in other books. Briefly, functions are regarded as pure, meaning their behavior is determined solely by their arguments. Methods are inherently impure, given that one of their argu- ments is effectively a side effect. These are muddy waters, though. Functions are perfectly capable of acting on side effects themselves. Moreover, methods are implemented with functions. And, to add an exception to an exception, objects sometimes implement static methods, which do not include implicit arguments.

Is there a way to provide a more sophisticated result type to contain an error message if the OS reports one? The issue arises because dealing with hardware is unreliable. Even ignoring hardware faults, the disk might be full or the OS might intervene and tell you that you don’t have permission to delete a particular file. This section discusses different methods for signalling that an error has occurred, beginning with approaches common in other languages and finishing with idiomatic Rust. 3.4.1 Modifying a known global variable One of the simplest methods for signalling that an error has occurred is by checking the value of a global variable. Although notoriously error-prone, this is a common idiom in systems programming.  C programmers are used to checking the value of errno once system calls return. As an example, the close() system call closes a file descriptor (an integer representing a file with numbers assigned by the OS) and can modify errno. The section of the POSIX standard discussing the close() system call includes this snippet: “If close() is interrupted by a signal that is to be caught, it shall return -1 with errno set to EINTR and the state of fildes [file descriptor] is unspecified. If an I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to the file system during close(), it may return -1 with errno set to EIO; if this error is returned, the state of fildes is unspecified.” —The Open Group Base Specifications (2018) Setting errno to either EIO or EINTR means to set it to some magical internal constant. The specific values are arbitrary and defined per OS. With the Rust syntax, checking global variables for error codes would look something like the following listing.

This type is known as Result. Result has two states, Ok and Err. This two-headed type is versatile and is put to work all through the standard library.  We’ll consider how a single type can act as two later on. For the moment, let’s investigate the mechanics of working with it. Listing 3.8 makes changes from previ- ous iterations: \\uf0a1Functions that interact with the file system, such as open() on line 39, return Result<File, String>. This effectively allows two types to be returned. When the function successfully executes, File is returned within a wrapper as Ok(File). When the function encounters an error, it returns a String within its own wrap- per as Err(String). Using a String as an error type provides an easy way to report error messages. \\uf0a1Calling functions that return Result<File, String> requires an extra method (unwrap()) to actually extract the value. The unwrap() call unwraps Ok(File) to produce File. It will crash the program if it encounters Err(String). More sophisticated error handling is explained in chapter 4. \\uf0a1 open() and close() now take full ownership of their File arguments. While we’ll defer a full explanation of the term ownership until chapter 4, it deserves a short explanation here. Rust’s ownership rules dictate when values are deleted. Passing the File argument to open() or close() without prepending an ampersand, e.g. &File or &mut File, passes ownership to the function that is being called. This would ordinarily mean that the argument is deleted when the function ends, but these two also return their arguments at the end. \\uf0a1The f4 variable now needs to reclaim ownership. Associated with the changes to the open() and close() functions is a change to the number of times that let f4 is used. f4 is now rebound after each call to open() and close().

Classi- cally, an enum represents several predefined known options like the suits of playing cards or planets in the solar system. The following listing shows one such enum. enum Suit {   Clubs,   Spades,   Diamonds,   Hearts, } If you haven’t programmed in a language that makes use of enums, understanding their value takes some effort. As you program with these for a while, though, you’re likely to experience a minor epiphany.  Consider creating some code that parses event logs. Each event has a name, per- haps UPDATE or DELETE. Rather than storing those values as strings in your application, which can lead to subtle bugs later on when string comparisons become unwieldy, enums allow you to give the compiler some knowledge of the event codes. Later, you’ll be given a warning such as “Hi there, I see that you have considered the UPDATE case, but it looks like you’ve forgotten the DELETE case. You should fix that.”  Listing 3.10 shows the beginnings of an application that parses text and emits structured data. When run, the program produces the following output.

Con- sider them for your code when you discover yourself introducing “stringly-typed” data, such as message codes.  3.6 Defining common behavior with traits A robust definition of the term file needs to be agnostic to storage medium. Files sup- port two main operations: reading and writing streams of bytes. Focusing on those two capabilities allows us to ignore where the reads and writes are actually taking place. These actions can be from a hard disk drive, an in-memory cache, over a network, or via something more exotic.  Irrespective of whether a file is a network connection, a spinning metal platter, or a superposition of an electron, it’s possible to define rules that say, “To call yourself a file, you must implement this.”  You have already seen traits in action several times. Traits have close relatives in other languages. These are often named interfaces, protocols, type classes, abstract base classes, or, perhaps, contracts.  Every time you’ve used #[derive(Debug)] in a type definition, you’ve imple- mented the Debug trait for that type. Traits permeate the Rust language. Let’s see how to create one. 3.6.1 Creating a Read trait Traits enable the compiler (and other humans) to know that multiple types are attempting to perform the same task. Types that use #[derive(Debug)] all print to the console via the println! macro and its relatives.

These underlie Rust’s generics system and the language’s robust type checking. With a little bit of abuse, these also support a form of inheritance that’s common in most object oriented lan- guages. For now, though, the thing to remember is that traits represent common behavior that types opt into via the syntax impl Trait for Type.  3.7 Exposing your types to the world Your crates will interact with others that you build over time. You might want to make that process easier for your future self by hiding internal details and documenting what’s public. This section describes some of the tooling available within the language and within cargo to make that process easier. 3.7.1 Protecting private data Rust defaults to keeping things private. If you were to create a library with only the code that you have seen so far, importing your crate would provide no extra benefit. To remedy this, use the pub keyword to make things public.  Listing 3.16 provides a few examples of prefixing types and methods with pub. As you’ll note, its output is not very exciting: File { name: \"f7.txt\", data: [], state: Closed }  1 #[derive(Debug,PartialEq)]  2 pub enum FileState {       3   Open,  4   Closed,  5 }  6   7 #[derive(Debug)]  8 pub struct File {  9   pub name: String, 10   data: Vec<u8>,              11   pub state: FileState, 12 } 13  14 impl File { 15   pub fn new(name: &str) -> File {     16     File { 17         name: String::from(name), Listing 3.16 Using pub to mark the name and state fields of File public The Debug implementation prints a familiar  message in common with all other  implementors of Debug: File { … }. Our Display implementation  follows its own rules, displaying  itself as <f6.txt (CLOSED)>. An enum’s variants are  assumed to be public if the  overall type is made public.

Instead of produc- ing executable code, it produces HTML versions of your inline documentation.  Here is how to use it. Assuming that you have the code from listing 3.17 saved as ch3-file-doced.rs, follow these steps: 1 Open a terminal. 2 Move to the location of your source file. 3 Execute rustdoc ch3-file-doced.rs. rustdoc creates a directory (doc/) for you. The documentation’s entry point is actu- ally within a subdirectory: doc/ch3_file_doced/index.html.  When your programs start to get larger and span multiple files, invoking rustdoc manually can become a bit of a pain. Thankfully, cargo can do the grunt work on your behalf. That’s discussed in the next section.  3.8.2 Using cargo to render docs for a crate and its dependencies Your documentation can be rendered as rich HTML output with cargo. cargo works with crates rather than the individual files as we’ve worked with so far. To get around this, we’ll move our project into a crate documentation: To manually create the crate, following these instructions: 1 Open a terminal. 2 Move to a working directory, such as /tmp/, or for Windows, type cd %TEMP%. 3 Run cargo new filebasics. You should end up with a project directory tree that looks like this: filebasics ├──Cargo.toml └──src    └──main.rs     4 Now save the source code from listing 3.17 to filebasics/src/main.rs, overwrit- ing the “Hello World!” boilerplate code that is already in the file.

The details of borrow checking are thoroughly explored within the chapter. However, a few points might be useful for readers want- ing to quickly get the gist. Borrow checking relies on three interrelated concepts— lifetimes, ownership, and borrowing: \\uf0a1Ownership is a stretched metaphor. There is no relationship to property rights. Within Rust, ownership relates to cleaning values when these are no longer needed. For example, when a function returns, the memory holding its local variables needs to be freed. Owners cannot prevent other parts of the program from accessing their values or report data theft to some overarching Rust authority. \\uf0a1A value’s lifetime is the period when accessing that value is valid behavior. A function’s local variables live until the function returns, while global variables might live for the life of the program. \\uf0a1To borrow a value means to access it. This terminology is somewhat confusing as there is no obligation to return the value to its owner. Its meaning is used to emphasize that while values can have a single owner, it’s possible for many parts of the program to share access to those values. 4.1 Implementing a mock CubeSat ground station Our strategy for this chapter is to use an example that compiles. Then we’ll make a minor change that triggers an error that appears to emerge without any adjustment to the program’s flow. Working through the fixes to those issues should make the con- cepts more complete.  The learning example for the chapter is a CubeSat constellation. If you’ve never encountered that phrase before, here are some definitions: \\uf0a1CubeSat—A miniature artificial satellite, as compared to a conventional satellite, that has increasingly expanded the accessibility of space research. \\uf0a1Ground station—An intermediary between the operators and the satellites them- selves. It listens on a radio, checking the status of every satellite in the constella- tion and transmitting messages to and fro. When introduced in our code, it acts as the gateway between the user and the satellites. \\uf0a1Constellation—The collective noun for satellites in orbit.

This model can happily implement integers for the moment. We don’t need to model the ground station explicitly because we’re not yet sending messages around the con- stellations. We’ll omit that model for now. These are the variables: let sat_a = 0; let sat_b = 1; let sat_c = 2; To check on the status of each of our satellites, we’ll use a stub function and an enum to represent potential status messages: #[derive(Debug)] enum StatusMessage {   Ok,                                       } fn check_status(sat_id: u64) -> StatusMessage {   StatusMessage::Ok                         } The check_status() function would be extremely complicated in a production sys- tem. For our purposes, though, returning the same value every time is perfectly suffi- cient.

It turns out that although it is written in English, the term move means something very specific within Rust. Nothing physically moves.  Movement within Rust code refers to movement of ownership, rather than the movement of data. Ownership is a term used within the Rust community to refer to the compile-time process that checks that every use of a value is valid and that every value is destroyed cleanly.  Every value in Rust is owned. In both listings 4.1 and 4.3, sat_a, sat_b, and sat_c own the data that these refer to. When calls to check_status() are made, ownership of the data moves from the variables in the scope of main() to the variable sat_id within the check_status() function. The significant difference is that listing 4.3 places that integer within a CubeSat struct.1 This type change alters the semantics of how the program behaves. 1 Remember the phrase zero-cost abstractions?

It is centered on sat_a and attempts to show how ownership moves from main() into check_status(). fn main() {   let sat_a = CubeSat { id: 0 };      // ...        let a_status = check_status(sat_a);      // ...        // \"waiting\" ...   let a_status = check_status(sat_a);      // ...      } Figure 4.2 provides a visual walk-through of the interrelated processes of control flow, ownership, and lifetimes. During the call to check_status(sat_a), ownership moves to the check_status() function. When check_status() returns a StatusMessage, it drops the sat_a value. The lifetime of sat_a ends here. Yet, sat_a remains in the local scope of main() after the first call to check_status(). Attempting to access that variable will incur the wrath of the borrow checker.  The distinction between a value’s lifetime and its scope—which is what many pro- grammers are trained to rely on—can make things difficult to disentangle. Avoiding and overcoming this type of issue makes up the bulk of this chapter. Figure 4.2 helps to shed some light on this.  4.1.2 Special behavior of primitive types Before carrying on, it might be wise to explain why listing 4.1 compiled at all. Indeed, the only change that we made in listing 4.3 was to wrap our satellite variables in a cus- tom type. As it happens, primitive types in Rust have special behavior. These imple- ment the Copy trait. Listing 4.4 Extract of listing 4.3, focusing on main() Rebinding is legal when values are not borrowed If you have experience with programming languages such as JavaScript (from 2015 onward), you may have been surprised to see that the variables for each of the CubeSats were redefined in listing 4.3. In that listing on line 20, a_status is assigned to the result of the first call to check_status(sat_a). On line 26, it is reassigned to the result of the second call. The original value is overwritten. This is legal Rust code, but one must be aware of ownership issues and lifetime here too. It’s possible in this context because there are no live borrows to contend with. Attempting to overwrite a value that’s still available from elsewhere in the program causes the compiler to refuse to compile your program. Ownership originates  here at the creation of  the CubeSat object. Lines skipped for brevity Ownership of the object  moves to check_status() but  is not returned to main().

       "  'text': '115 How ownership moves 4.3 What is an owner? Does it have any responsibilities? In the world of Rust, the notion of ownership is rather limited. An owner cleans up when its values’ lifetimes end.  When values go out of scope or their lifetimes end for some other reason, their destructors are called. A destructor is a function that removes traces of the value from the program by deleting references and freeing memory. You won’t find a call to any destructors in most Rust code. The compiler injects that code itself as part of the pro- cess of tracking every value’s lifetime.  To provide a custom destructor for a type, we implement Drop. This typically is needed in cases where we have used unsafe blocks to allocate memory. Drop has one method, drop(&mut self), that you can use to conduct any necessary wind-up activities.  An implication of this system is that values cannot outlive their owner. This kind of situation can make data structures built with references, such as trees and graphs, feel slightly bureaucratic. If the root node of a tree is the owner of the whole tree, it can’t be removed without taking ownership into account.  Finally, unlike the Lockean notion of personal property, ownership does not imply control or sovereignty. In fact, the “owners” of values do not have special access to their owned data. Nor do these have the ability to restrict others from trespassing. Owners don’t get a say on other sections of code borrowing their values.  4.4 How ownership moves There are two ways to shift ownership from one variable to another within a Rust pro- gram. The first is by assignment.2 The second is by passing data through a function barrier, either as an argument or a return value. Revisiting our original code from list- ing 4.3, we can see that sat_a starts its life with ownership over a CubeSat object: fn main() {   let sat_a = CubeSat { id: 0 };   // ... The CubeSat object is then passed into check_status() as an argument. This moves ownership to the local variable sat_id: fn main() {   let sat_a = CubeSat { id: 0 };   // ...   let a_status = check_status(sat_a);   // ... Another possibility is that sat_a relinquishes its ownership to another variable within main(). That would look something like this: 2 Within the Rust community, the term variable binding  is preferred because it is more technically correct.',\n",

It provides a route to memory safety without needing a garbage collector. There is a “but,” however.  The ownership system can trip you up if you don’t understand what’s happening. This is particularly the case when you bring the programming style from your past experience to a new paradigm. Four general strategies can help with ownership issues: \\uf0a1Use references where full ownership is not required. \\uf0a1Duplicate the value. \\uf0a1Refactor code to reduce the number of long-lived objects. \\uf0a1Wrap your data in a type designed to assist with movement issues. To examine each of these strategies, let’s extend the capabilities of our satellite net- work. Let’s give the ground station and our satellites the ability to send and receive messages. Figure 4.5 shows what we want to achieve: create a message at Step 1, then transfer it at Step 2. After Step 2, no ownership issues should arise. Ignoring the details of implementing the methods, we want to avoid code that looks like the following. Moving ownership of sat_a to a local variable in base.send() ends up hurting us. That value will no longer be accessible for the rest of main(): base.send(sat_a, \"hello!\");     sat_a.recv(); To get to a “toy” implementation, we need a few more types to help us out somewhat. In listing 4.8, we add a new field, mailbox, to CubeSat. CubeSat.mailbox is a Mailbox struct that contains a vector of Messages within its messages field.

Instead of requesting ownership, you can use a “borrow” in your function definitions. For read-only access, use & T. For read-write access, use &mut T.

For simplic- ity’s sake, we’ll return () and hope for the best in case of transmission difficulties caused by solar winds.  The following snippet shows the flow that we want to end up with. The ground sta- tion can send a message to sat_a with its send() method, and sat_a then receives the message with its recv() method: base.send(sat_a, \"hello!\".to_string()); let msg = sat_a.recv(); println!(\"sat_a received: {:?}\", msg); // -> Option(\"hello!\") The next listing shows the implementations of these methods. To achieve that flow, add the implementations to GroundStation and CubeSat types.  1 impl GroundStation {  2     fn send(  3       &self,               4       to: &mut CubeSat,    5       msg: Message,        6     ) {  7         to.mailbox.messages.push(msg);     8     }  9 } 10  11 impl CubeSat { 12     fn recv(&mut self) -> Option<Message> { 13         self.mailbox.messages.pop() 14     } 15 } Notice that both GroundStation.send() and CubeSat.recv() require mutable access to a CubeSat instance because both methods modify the underlying CubeSat.messages vector. We move ownership of the message that we’re sending into the messages.push(). This provides us with some quality assurance later, notifying us if we access a message after it’s already sent. Figure 4.6 illustrates how we can avoid ownership issues.

When send() returns, to is deleted. Adding the &mut prefix to the CubeSat type allows  the outer scope to retain ownership of data referred to  by the to variable.

Rather than using an approach involving long-standing objects, consider making objects that are more discrete and ephemeral. Ownership issues can sometimes be resolved by considering the design of the overall program.  In our CubeSat case, we don’t need to handle much complexity at all. Each of our four variables—base, sat_a, sat_b, and sat_c—live for the duration of main(). In a production system, there can be hundreds of different components and many thousands of interactions to manage. To increase the manageability of this kind of scenario, let’s break things apart. Figure 4.7 presents the game plan for this section.  To implement this kind of strategy, we will create a function that returns CubeSat identifiers. That function is assumed to be a black box that’s responsible for commu- nicating with some store of identifiers, such as a database. When we need to communi- cate with a satellite, we’ll create a new object, as the following code snippet shows. In this way, there is no requirement for us to maintain live objects for the whole of the program’s duration. It also has the dual benefit that we can afford to transfer owner- ship of our short-lived variables to other functions: fn fetch_sat_ids() -> Vec<u64> {      vec![1,2,3] } We’ll also create a method for GroundStation. This method allows us to create a CubeSat instance on demand once: impl GroundStation {   fn connect(&self, sat_id: u64) -> CubeSat {     CubeSat { id: sat_id, mailbox: Mailbox { messages: vec![] } }   } } Now we are a bit closer to our intended outcome.

Our CubeSat instances die at the end of the for loop’s scope, along with any messages that base sends to them. To carry on with our design decision of short-lived variables, the messages need to live somewhere outside of the CubeSat instances. In a real system, these would live on the RAM of a device in zero gravity. In our not-really-a-simulator, let’s put these in a buffer object that lives for the duration of our program.  Our message store will be a Vec<Message> (our Mailbox type defined in one of the first code examples of this chapter). We’ll change the Message struct to add a sender and recipient field, as the following code shows. That way our now-proxy CubeSat instances can match their IDs to receive messages: #[derive(Debug)] struct Mailbox {   messages: Vec<Message>, } #[derive(Debug)] struct Message {     to: u64,     content: String, } We also need to reimplement sending and receiving messages.

When any of the satellites transmit messages, these take a mutable borrow to the mailbox. These then defer the delivery to the mailbox object.

There are three main reasons: \\uf0a1The Copy trait implies that there will only be negligible performance impact. This is true for numbers but not true for types that are arbitrarily large, such as String. \\uf0a1Because Copy creates exact copies, it cannot treat references correctly. Naïvely copying a reference to T would (attempt to) create a second owner of T. That would cause problems later on because there would be multiple attempts to delete T as each reference is deleted. \\uf0a1Some types overload the Clone trait. This is done to provide something similar to, yet different from, creating duplicates. For example, std::rc::Rc<T> uses Clone to create additional references when .clone() is called.

A final strategy that is quite common is to use wrapper types, which allow more flexibility than what is available by default. These, however, incur costs at runtime to ensure that Rust’s safety guarantees are maintained. Another way to phrase this is that Rust allows programmers to opt in to garbage collection.3  To explain the wrapper type strategy, let’s introduce a wrapper type: std:rc::Rc. std:rc::Rc takes a type parameter T and is typically referred to as Rc<T>. Rc<T> reads as “R. C. of T” and stands for “a reference-counted value of type T.” Rc<T> provides shared ownership of T. Shared ownership prevents T from being removed from memory until every owner is removed.  As indicated by the name, reference counting is used to track valid references. As each reference is created, an internal counter increases by one. When a reference is dropped, the count decreases by one. When the count hits zero, T is also dropped.  Wrapping T involves a calling Rc::new(). The following listing, at ch4/ch4-rc- groundstation.rs, shows this approach.     Listing 4.18 Using Clone and Copy 3 Garbage collection (often abbreviated as GC) is a strategy for memory management used by many program- ming languages, including Python and JavaScript, and all languages built on the JVM (Java, Scala, Kotlin) or the CLR (C#, F#).

The type system—not the CPU—is what makes this dis- tinction. The following shows the listing’s output: a: 1100001111000011 50115 b: 1100001111000011 -15421  1 fn main() {  2   let a: u16 = 50115;  3   let b: i16 = -15421;  4   5   println!(\"a: {:016b} {}\", a, a);     6   println!(\"b: {:016b} {}\", b, b);     7 } The different mapping between bit strings and numbers explains part of the distinc- tion between binary files and text files. Text files are just binary files that happen to follow a consistent mapping between bit strings and characters. This mapping is called an encoding. Arbitrary files don’t describe their meaning to the outside world, which makes these opaque.  We can take this process one step further.

The 032 reads as “left-pad with 32 zeros” and the right-hand b invokes the std::fmt::Binary trait. This contrasts with the default syntax ({}), which invokes the std::fmt ::Display trait, or the question mark syntax ({:?}), which invokes std::fmt:: Debug. Unfortunately for us, f32 doesn’t implement std::fmt::Binary. Luckily, Rust’s integer types do. There are two integer types guaranteed to take up the same number of bits as f32—i32 and u32. The decision about which to choose is somewhat arbitrary. \\uf0a1Lines 3–5 perform the conversion discussed in the previous bulleted point. The std:: mem::transmute() function asks Rust to naïvely interpret an f32 as an u32 with- out affecting any of the underlying bits. The inverse conversion is repeated later on lines 10–12. Mixing data types in a program is inherently chaotic, so we need to wrap these opera- tion within unsafe blocks. unsafe tells the Rust compiler, “Stand back, I’ll take care of things from here. I’ve got this.” It’s a signal to the compiler that you have more con- text than it does to verify the correctness of the program.  Using the unsafe keyword does not imply that code is inherently dangerous. For example, it does not allow you to bypass Rust’s borrow checker. It indicates that the compiler is not able to guarantee that the program’s memory is safe by itself. Using unsafe means that the programmer is fully responsible for maintaining the program’s integrity. WARNING Some functionality allowed within unsafe blocks is more difficult to verify than others. For example, the std::mem::transmute() function is one of the least safe in the language. It shreds all type safety. Investigate alter- natives before using it in your own code. Needlessly using unsafe blocks is heavily frowned upon within the Rust community. It can expose your software to critical security vulnerabilities. Its primary purpose is to allow Rust to interact with external code, such as libraries written in other languages and OS interfaces. This book uses unsafe more frequently than many projects because its code examples are teaching tools, not industrial software. unsafe allows you to peek at and poke at individual bytes, which is essential knowledge for people seeking to understand how computers work.  5.2 Life of an integer During earlier chapters, we spent some time discussing what it means for an integer to be an i32, an u8, or an usize.

Developing strategies for preventing integer overflow is one of the ways that system programmers are distinguished from others. Programmers who only have experience with dynamic languages are extremely unlikely to encounter an integer overflow. Dynamic languages typically check to see that the results of integer expressions will fit. When these can’t, the variable that’s receiving the result is promoted to a wider inte- ger type.  When developing performance critical code, you get to choose which parameters to adjust. If you use fixed-sized types, you gain speed, but you need to accept some risk. To mitigate the risk, you can check to see that overflow won’t occur at runtime. Imposing those checks will slow you down, however. Another, much more common option, is to sacrifice space by using a large integer type, such as i64. To go higher still, you’ll need to move to arbitrarily sized integers, which come with their own costs. 5.2.1 Understanding endianness CPU vendors argue about how the individual bytes that make up integers should be laid out. Some CPUs order multibyte sequences left to right and others are right to left. This characteristic is known as a CPU’s endianness.

To take you back to when you learned addition, we can factor the number 123 into three parts: Summing all of these parts gets us back to our original number. The first part, 100, is labeled as the most significant. When written out in the conventional way, 123 as 123, we are writing in big endian format. Were we to invert that ordering by writing 123 as 321, we would be writing in little endian format.  Binary numbers work in a similar way. Each number part is a power of 2 (20, 21, 22,…, 2n), rather than a power of 10 (100, 101, 102,…, 10n).  Before the late-1990s, endianness was a big issue, especially in the server market. Glossing over the fact that a number of processors can support bidirectional endian- ness, Sun Microsystems, Cray, Motorola, and SGI went one way. ARM decided to hedge its bet and developed a bi-endian architecture. Intel went the other way. The other way won. Integers are almost certainly stored in little endian format.  In addition to multibyte sequences, there is a related problem within a byte. Should an u8 that represents 3 look like 0000_0011, or should it look like 1100_0000? The computer’s preference for layout of individual bits is known as its bit numbering or bit endianness. It’s unlikely, however, that this internal ordering will affect your day-to- day programming. To investigate further, look for your platform’s documentation to find out on which end its most significant bit lies. NOTE The abbreviation MSB can be deceptive. Different authors use the same abbreviation to refer to two concepts: most significant bit and most sig- nificant byte. To avoid confusion, this text uses the term bit numbering to refer to the most significant bit and endianness to refer to most significant byte.  5.3 Representing decimal numbers One of the claims made at the start of this chapter was that understanding more about bit patterns enables you to compress your data. Let’s put that into practice. In this sec- tion, you will learn how to pull bits out of a floating-point number and inject those into a single byte format of your own creation.

The numbers within those models often fall within the ranges 0..=1 or -1..=1 (using Rust’s range syntax), depending on the application. Given that we don’t need the whole range that f32 or f64 supports, why use all of these bytes? Let’s see how far we can get with 1. Because there is a known limited range, it’s possible to create a decimal number format that can model that range compactly.  To start, we’re going to need to learn about how decimal numbers are represented inside today’s computers. This means learning about the internals of floating-point numbers.  5.4 Floating-point numbers Each floating-point number is laid out in memory as scientific notation. If you’re unfa- miliar with scientific notation, here is a quick primer.  Scientists describe the mass of Jupiter as 1.898 × 1027 kg and the mass of an ant as 3.801 × 10–4 kg. The key insight is that the same number of characters are used to describe vastly different scales. Computer scientists have taken advantage of that insight to create a fixed-width format that encodes a wide range of numbers. Each position within a number in scientific notation is given a role: \\uf0a1A sign, which is implied in our two examples, would be present for negative numbers (negative infinity to 0). \\uf0a1The mantissa, also known as the significand, can be thought of as being the value in question (1.898 and 3.801, for example). \\uf0a1The radix, also known as the base, is the value that is raised to the power of the exponent (10 in both of our examples). \\uf0a1The exponent describes the scale of the values (27 and –4). This crosses over to floating point quite neatly. A floating-point value is a container with three fields: \\uf0a1A sign bit \\uf0a1An exponent \\uf0a1A mantissa Where is the radix? The standard defines it as 2 for all floating-point types. This defini- tion allows the radix to be omitted from the bit pattern itself. 5.4.1 Looking inside an f32 Figure 5.1 presents the memory layout of the f32 type in Rust. The layout is called binary32 within the IEEE 754-2019 and IEEE 754-2008 standards and single by their predecessor, IEE 754-1985.   The  value  42.42  is  encoded  as  f32  with  the  bit  pattern 01000010001010011010111000010100. That bit pattern is more compactly repre- sented as 0x4229AE14.

However, it’s actually not necessary to do so because the following decoding steps can simply ignore bits as irrelevant. Unfortunately, the man- tissa’s decoding step is significantly more complex than the exponent’s.  To decode the mantissa’s bits, multiply each bit by its weight and sum the result. The first bit’s weight is 0.5, and each subsequent bit’s weight is half of the current weight; for example, 0.5 (2–1), 0.25 (2–2),…, 0.00000011920928955078125 (2–23). An implicit 24th bit that represents 1.0 (2–0) is always considered to be on, except when special cases are triggered. Special cases are triggered by the state of the exponent: \\uf0a1When the exponent’s bits are all 0s, then the treatment of mantissa’s bits changes to repre- sent subnormal numbers (also known as “denormal numbers”). In practical terms, this change increases the number of decimal numbers near zero that can be repre- sented. Formally, a subnormal number is one between 0 and the smallest num- ber that the normal behavior would otherwise be able to represent. \\uf0a1When the exponent’s bits are all 1s, then the decimal number is infinity (\\uf0a5), negative infinity (–\\uf0a5), or Not a Number (NAN). NAN values indicate special cases where the numeric result is mathematically undefined (such as 0 ÷ 0) or that are other- wise invalid. Operations involving NAN values are often counterintuitive. For example, testing whether two values are equal is always false, even when the two bit pat- terns are exactly the same. An interesting curiosity is that f32 has approximately 4.2 million (~222) bit patterns that represent NAN.

Sections 5.4.1–5.4.3 have given us the tools that we need to extract each of these fields. Let’s put those to work.  Listing 5.10 does a round trip. It extracts the fields from the number 42.42 encoded as an f32 into individual parts, then assembles these again to create another number. To convert the bits within a floating-point number to a number, there are three tasks: 1 Extract the bits of those values from the container (to_parts() on lines 1–26) 2 Decode each value from its raw bit pattern to its actual value (decode() on lines 28–47) 3 Perform the arithmetic to convert from scientific notation to an ordinary num- ber (from_parts() on lines 49–55) When we run listing 5.10, it provides two views of the internals of the number 42.42 encoded as an f32: 42.42 -> 42.42 field    |  as bits | as real number sign     |        0 | 1 exponent | 10000100 | 32 mantissa | 01010011010111000010100 | 1.325625 In listing 5.10, deconstruct_f32() extracts each field of a floating-point value with bit manipulation techniques. decode_f32_parts() demonstrates how to convert those fields to the relevant number. The f32_from_parts() method combines these to create a single decimal number. The source for this file is located in ch5/ch5-visualizing-f32.rs. Parsing Rust’s floating-point literals is harder than it looks Rust’s numbers have methods. To return the nearest integer to 1.2, Rust uses the method 1.2_f32.ceil() rather than the function call ceil(1.2). While often con- venient, this can cause some issues when the compiler parses your source code. For example, unary minus has lower precedence than method calls, which means unexpected mathematical errors can occur. It is often helpful to use parentheses to make your intent clear to the compiler. To calculate –10, wrap 1.0 in parentheses (-1.0_f32).powf(0.0) rather than -1.0_f32.powf(0.0) which is interpreted as –(10). Because both –10 and –(10) are mathematically valid, Rust will not complain when parentheses are omitted.',\n",

These can be useful for representing fractions and are an option for performing calculations on CPUs without a floating point unit (FPU), such as micro- controllers. Unlike floating-point numbers, the decimal place does not move to dynami- cally accommodate different ranges. In our case, we’ll be using a fixed-point number format to compactly represent values between –1..=1. Although it loses accuracy, it saves significant space.2  The Q format is a fixed-point number format that uses a single byte.3 It was cre- ated by Texas Instruments for embedded computing devices. The specific version of the Q format that we will implement is called Q7. This indicates that there are 7 bits available for the represented number plus 1 sign bit. We’ll disguise the decimal nature of the type by hiding the 7 bits within an i8. That means that the Rust com- piler will be able to assist us in keeping track of the value’s sign. We will also be able to derive traits such as PartialEq and Eq, which provide comparison operators for our type, for free.  The following listing, an extract from listing 5.14, provides the type’s definition.

Imagine that you have a source of random bytes (u8), and you want to convert one of those into a floating-point (f32) value between 0 and 1. Naively interpreting the incoming bytes as f32/f64 via mem::transmute results in massive vari- ations in scale. The following listing demonstrates the division operation that gener- ates an f32 value that lies between 0 and 1 from an arbitrary input byte. fn mock_rand(n: u8) -> f32 {     (n as f32) / 255.0     } As division is a slow operation, perhaps there is something faster than simply dividing by the largest value that a byte can represent. Perhaps it’s possible to assume a con- stant exponent value, then shift the incoming bits into the mantissa, such that these would form a range between 0 and 1. Listing 5.16 with bit manipulation is the best result that I could achieve.  With an exponent of –1 represented as 0b01111110 (126 in base 10), the source byte achieves a range of 0.5 to 0.998. That can be normalized to 0.0 to 0.996 with sub- traction and multiplication. But is there a better way to do this?  1 fn mock_rand(n: u8) -> f32 {  2   3     let base: u32 = 0b0_01111110_00000000000000000000000;  4   5     let large_n = (n as u32) << 15;     6   7     let f32_bits = base | large_n;        8   9     let m = f32::from_bits(f32_bits);    10  11     2.0 * ( m - 0.5 )    12 } \\uf0a1Prefix things that you want to make public with the pub keyword. The pub key- word has some specialized cases: a pub(crate) exposes an item to other modules within the crate. b pub(super) exposes an item to the parent module. c pub(in path) exposes an item to a module within path. d pub(self) explicitly keeps the item private. \\uf0a1Bring items from other modules into local scope with the use keyword.

Operations and the data that is being operated on share the same encoding. This means that, as a general computing device, your com- puter can emulate other computers’ instruction sets by emulating those in software. While we cannot pull apart a CPU to see how it works, we can construct one with code.  After working through this section, you will learn how a computer operates at a fundamental level. This section shows how functions operate and what the term pointer means. We won’t have an assembly language; we’ll actually be programming directly in hex. This section also introduces you to another term you may have heard of in passing: the stack.  We’ll implement a subset of a system called CHIP-8, which was available to consum- ers in the 1970s. CHIP-8 was supported by a number of manufacturers, but it was fairly primitive even by the standards of that time. (It was created to write games rather than for commercial or scientific applications.)  One device that used the CHIP-8 CPU was the COSMAC VIP. It had a single-color display with a resolution of 64x32 (0.0002 megapixels), 2 KB RAM, 1.76 MHz CPU, and sold for $275 USD. Oh, and you needed to assemble the computer yourself.

This section provides a thorough explanation of the process used in the CHIP-8 and its naming conventions.  CHIP-8 opcodes are u16 values made up of 4 nibbles. A nibble is half of a byte. That is, a nibble is a 4-bit value. Because there isn’t a 4-bit type in Rust, splitting the u16 val- ues into those parts is fiddly. To make matters more complicated, CHIP-8 nibbles are often recombined to form either 8-bit or 12-bit values depending on context.  To simplify talking about the parts of each opcode, let’s introduce some standard terminology. Each opcode is made up of two bytes: the high byte and the low byte. And each byte is made up of two nibbles, the high nibble and the low nibble, respectively. Fig- ure 5.2 illustrates each term. Documentation manuals for the CHIP-8 introduce several variables, including kk, nnn, x, and y. Table 5.2 explains their role, location, and width.

Assuming that we wish to load that function into memory address 0x100, here are two options. First, if we have our function available as a slice, we can copy it across to memory with the copy_from_slice() method: fn main() {   let mut memory: [u8; 4096] = [0; 4096];   let mem = &mut memory;   let add_twice = [     0x80, 0x14,     0x80, 0x14,     0x00, 0xEE,   ];   mem[0x100..0x106].copy_from_slice(&add_twice);   println!(\"{:?}\", &mem[0x100..0x106]);    } An alternative approach that achieves the same effect within memory without requiring a temporary array is to overwrite bytes directly: fn main() {   let mut memory: [u8; 4096] = [0; 4096];   let mem = &mut memory;   mem[0x100] = 0x80; mem[0x101] = 0x14;   mem[0x102] = 0x80; mem[0x103] = 0x14;   mem[0x104] = 0x00; mem[0x105] = 0xEE;   println!(\"{:?}\", &mem[0x100..0x106]);    } The approach taken in the last snippet is exactly what is used within the main() func- tion of lines 96–98 of listing 5.29. Now that we know how to load a function into mem- ory, it’s time to learn how to instruct a CPU to actually call it.  IMPLEMENTING THE CALL AND RETURN OPCODES Calling a function is a three-step process: 1 Store the current memory location on the stack. 2 Increment the stack pointer. 3 Set the current memory location to the intended memory address. Returning from a function involves reversing the calling process: 1 Decrement the stack pointer. 2 Retrieve the calling memory address from the stack. 3 Set the current memory location to the intended memory address.

Congratulations on making it this far.  5.7.5 CPU 4: Adding the rest With a few extra opcodes, it’s possible to implement multiplication and many more functions within your inchoate CPU. Check the source code that comes along with the book, specifically the ch5/ch5-cpu4 directory at https://github.com/rust-in-action/ code for a fuller implementation of the CHIP-8 specification.  The last step in learning about CPUs and data is to understand how control flow works. Within CHIP-8, control flow works by comparing values in registers, then mod- ifying position_in_memory, depending on the outcome. There are no while or for loops within a CPU. Creating these in programming languages is the art of the com- piler writer.  Summary \\uf0a1The same bit pattern can represent multiple values, depending on its data type. \\uf0a1Integer types within Rust’s standard library have a fixed width. Attempting to increment past an integer’s maximum value is an error called an integer over- flow. Decrementing past its lowest value is called integer underflow. \\uf0a1Compiling programs with optimization enabled (for example, via cargo build --release) can expose your programs to integer overflow and underflow as run-time checks are disabled.

You’ll learn how to con- struct pointers, how to interact with an OS via its native API, and how to interact with other programs through Rust’s foreign function interface. 6.1 Pointers Pointers are how computers refer to data that isn’t immediately accessible. This topic tends to have an aura of mystique to it. That’s not necessary. If you’ve ever read a book’s table of contents, then you’ve used a pointer. Pointers are just numbers that refer to somewhere else.  If you’ve never encountered systems programming before, there is a lot of termi- nology to grapple with that describes unfamiliar concepts. Thankfully, though, what’s sitting underneath the abstraction is not too difficult to understand. The first thing to grasp is the notation used in this chapter’s figures. Figure 6.1 introduces three concepts: \\uf0a1The arrow refers to some location in memory that is determined at runtime rather than at compile time. \\uf0a1Each box represents a block of memory, and each block refers to a usize width. Other figures use a byte or perhaps even a bit as the chunk of memory these refer to. \\uf0a1The rounded box underneath the Value label represents three contiguous blocks of memory. For newcomers, pointers are scary and, at the same time, awe-inspiring. Their proper use requires that you know exactly how your program is laid out in memory. Imagine reading a table of contents that says chapter 4 starts on page 97, but it actually starts on page 107. That would be frustrating, but at least you could cope with the mistake.  A computer doesn’t experience frustration. It also lacks any intuition that it has pointed to the wrong place. It just keeps working, correctly or incorrectly, as if it had been given the correct location. The fear of pointers is that you will introduce some impossible-to-debug error. Pointers are typically denoted as arrows. Inside the computer, these are encoded as an integer (equivalent to usize), which is the memory adddress of their referent (the data that the pointer refers to).

To make use of that RAM, there needs to be some sort of retrieval system in place. An address space is that retrieval system.  Pointers are encoded as memory addresses, which are represented as integers of type usize. An address points to somewhere within the address space. For the moment, think of the address space as all of your RAM laid out end to end in a single line.  Why are memory addresses encoded as usize? Surely there’s no 64-bit computer with 264 bytes of RAM. The range of the address space is a façade provided by the OS and the CPU. Programs only know an orderly series of bytes, irrespective of the amount of RAM that is actually available in the system. We discuss how this works later in the virtual memory section of this chapter. NOTE Another interesting example is the Option<T> type. Rust uses null pointer optimization to ensure that an Option<T> occupies 0 bytes in the compiled binary. The None variant is represented by a null pointer (a pointer to invalid memory), allowing the Some(T) variant to have no additional indi- rection. What are the differences between references, pointers, and memory  addresses? References, pointers, and memory addresses are confusingly similar: \\uf0a1A memory address, often shortened to address, is a number that happens to refer to a single byte in memory. Memory addresses are abstractions provided by assembly languages. \\uf0a1A pointer, sometimes expanded to raw pointer, is a memory address that points to a value of some type. Pointers are abstractions provided by higher-level lan- guages. \\uf0a1A reference is a pointer, or in the case of dynamically sized types, a pointer and an integer with extra guarantees. References are abstractions provided by Rust. Compilers are able to determine spans of valid bytes for many types. For example, when a compiler creates a pointer to an i32, it can verify that there are 4 bytes that encode an integer. This is more useful than simply having a memory address, which may or may not point to any valid data type. Unfortunately, the programmer bears the responsibility for ensuring the validity for types with no known size at compile time. Rust’s references offer substantial benefits over pointers: \\uf0a1References always refer to valid data. Rust’s references can only be used when it’s legal to access their referent. I’m sure you’re familiar with this core tenet of Rust by now! \\uf0a1References are correctly aligned to multiples of usize.

Rust in Action tries to stick to the following guidelines when discussing these types: \\uf0a1References—Signal that the Rust compiler will provide its safety guarantees. \\uf0a1Pointers—Refer to something more primitive. This also includes the implication that we are responsible for maintaining safety. (There is an implied connota- tion of being unsafe.) \\uf0a1Raw pointers—Used for types where it’s important to make their unsafe nature explicit. Throughout this section, we’ll expand on a common code fragment introduced by listing 6.1. Its source code is available in ch6/ch6-pointer-intro.rs. In the listing, two global variables, B and C, are pointed to by references. Those references hold the addresses of B and C, respectively. A view of what’s happening follows the code in fig- ures 6.2 and 6.3. static B: [u8; 10] = [99, 97, 114, 114, 121, 116, 111, 119, 101, 108]; static C: [u8; 11] = [116, 104, 97, 110, 107, 115, 102, 105, 115, 104, 0]; fn main() {     let a = 42;     let b = &B;        let c = &C;        println!(\"a: {}, b: {:p}, c: {:p}\", a, b, c);     } (continued) They operate much more slowly. To mitigate this problem, Rust’s types actu- ally include padding bytes so that creating references to these does not slow down your program. \\uf0a1References are able to provide these guarantees for dynamically sized types. For types with no fixed width in memory, Rust ensures that a length is kept alongside the internal pointer. That way Rust can ensure that the program never overruns the type’s space in memory. NOTE The distinguishing characteristic between memory addresses and the two higher abstractions is that the latter two have information about the type of their referent.  Listing 6.1 Mimicking pointers with references For simplicity, uses the same  reference type for this example.  Later examples distinguish smart  pointers from raw pointers and  require different types. The {:p} syntax asks  Rust to format the  variable as a pointer  and prints the memory  address that the value  points to.',\n",

Avoiding copies increases runtime performance. std::ffi is the foreign function interface module from Rust’s standard library. use std::os::raw::c_char; is not strictly needed, but it does make the code’s intent clear. C does not define the width of its char type in its standard, although it’s one byte wide in practice. Retrieving the type alias c_char from the std::os:raw module allows for differences.

String is a smart pointer  type that holds a pointer to  a backing array and a field  to store its size. Cow accepts a type parameter for  the data it points to; str is the type  returned by CStr.to_string_lossy(),  so it is appropriate here. References cannot be  cast directly to *mut T,  the type required by  String::from_raw_parts().  But *const T can be cast  to *mut T, leading to this  double cast syntax. String::from_raw_parts()  accepts a pointer (*mut T)  to an array of bytes, a size,  and a capacity parameter. Converts a *const u8 to a  *const i8, aliased to c_char.  The conversion to i8 works  because we remain under 128,  following the ASCII standard.

We first need to work through what raw pointers are and then discuss a number of feature-rich alternatives that have been built around them. 6.2.1 Raw pointers in Rust A raw pointer is a memory address without Rust’s standard guarantees. These are inher- ently unsafe. For example, unlike references (&T), raw pointers can be null.  If you’ll forgive the syntax, raw pointers are denoted as *const T and *mut T for immutable and mutable raw pointers, respectively. Even though each is a single type, these contain three tokens: *, const or mut. Their type, T, a raw pointer to a String, looks like *const String. A raw pointer to an i32 looks like *mut i32. But before we put pointers into practice, here are two other things that are useful to know: \\uf0a1The difference between a *mut T and a *const T is minimal. These can be freely cast between one another and tend to be used interchangeably, acting as in-source documentation. \\uf0a1Rust references (&mut T and &T) compile down to raw pointers. That means that it’s possible to access the performance of raw pointers without needing to venture into unsafe blocks. The next listing provides a small example that coerces a reference to a value (&T), cre- ating a raw pointer from an i64 value. It then prints the value and its address in mem- ory via the {:p} syntax. fn main() {     let a: i64 = 42;     let a_ptr = &a as *const i64;        println!(\"a: {} ({:p})\", a, a_ptr);    } The terms pointer and memory address are sometimes used interchangeably. These are integers that represent a location in virtual memory. From the compiler’s point of view, though, there is one important difference. Rust’s pointer types *const T and *mut T always point to the starting byte of T, and these also know the width of type T in bytes. A memory address might refer to anywhere in memory.  An i64 is 8-bytes wide (64 bits ÷ 8 bits per byte). Therefore, if an i64 is stored at address 0x7fffd, then each of the bytes between 0x7ffd..0x8004 must be fetched from RAM to recreate the integer’s value. The process of fetching data from RAM from a pointer is known as dereferencing a pointer. The following listing identifies a value’s address by casting a reference to it as a raw pointer via std::mem::transmute.   Listing 6.4 Creating a raw pointer (*const T) Casts a reference to the  variable a (&a) to a constant  raw pointer i64 (*const i64) Prints the value of the variable  a (42) and its address in  memory (0x7ff…)',\n",

Raw pointers are common within C code that provides an external interface. \\uf0a1Shared access to something is essential and runtime performance is paramount. Perhaps multiple components within your application require equal access to some expensive-to-compute variable. If you’re willing to take on the risk of one of those components poisoning every other component with some silly mistake, then raw pointers are an option of last resort.  6.2.2 Rust’s pointer ecosystem Given that raw pointers are unsafe, what is the safer alternative? The alternative is to use smart pointers. In the Rust community, a smart pointer is a pointer type that has some kind of superpower, over and above the ability to deference a memory address. You will probably encounter the term wrapper type as well. Rust’s smart pointer types tend to wrap raw pointers and bestow them with added semantics.  A narrower definition of smart pointer is common in the C communities. There authors (generally) imply that the term smart pointer means the C equivalents of Rust’s core::ptr::Unique, core::ptr::Shared, and std::rc::Weak types. We will introduce these types shortly. NOTE The term fat pointer refers to memory layout. Thin pointers, such as raw pointers, are a single usize wide. Fat pointers are usually two usize wide, and occasionally more. Rust has an extensive set of pointer (and pointer-like) types in its standard library. Each has its own role, strengths, and weaknesses. Given their unique properties, rather than writing these out as a list, let’s model these as characters in a card-based role-playing game, as shown in figure 6.4.  Each of the pointer types introduced here are used extensively throughout the book. As such, we’ll give these fuller treatment when that’s needed. For now, the two novel attributes that appear within the Powers section of some of these cards are inte- rior mutability and shared ownership. These two terms warrant some discussion.  With interior mutability, you may want to provide an argument to a method that takes immutable values, yet you need to retain mutability. If you’re willing to pay the runtime performance cost, it’s possible to fake immutability. If the method requires an owned value, wrap the argument in Cell<T>. References can also be wrapped in RefCell<T>. It is common when using the reference counted types Rc<T> and Arc<T>, which only accept immutable arguments, to also wrap those in Cell<T> or Ref- Cell<T>. The resulting type might look like Rc<RefCell<T>>. This means that you pay the runtime cost twice but with significantly more flexibility.  With shared ownership, some objects, such as a network connection or, perhaps, access to some OS service, are difficult to mould into the pattern of having a single place with read-write access at any given time.

Powers • Speed • Can interact with the outside world Weaknesses • Unsafe Box<T> Store anything in a box. Accepts almost any type for long-term storage. The workhorse of a new, safe programming era. Powers • Store a value in central storage in a location called “the heap” Weaknesses • Size increase Rc<T> The reference counted pointer, Rc<T> is Rust's competent, yet miserly bookkeeper. It knows who has borrowed what and when. Powers • Shared access to values Weaknesses • Size increase • Runtime cost • Not threadsafe Cell<T> An expert in metamorphosis, Cell<T> confers the ability to mutate immutable values. Powers • Interior mutability Weaknesses • Size increase • Performance RefCell<T> Performs mutation on immutable references with RefCel<T>. Its mind-bending powers come with some costs. Weaknesses • Size increase • Runtime cost • Lack of compile- time guarantees Cow<T> Why write something down when you only need to read it? Perhaps you only want to make modiﬁcations. This is the role of Cow (copy on write). Powers • Avoids writes when only read access is used Weaknesses • Possible size increase Arc<T> Your program’s main storage system. Vec<T> keeps your data orderly as values are created and destroyed.

Regardless, it might be useful to know that Rust’s pointer types are extensi- ble—these are designed with extension in mind.  All of the programmer-facing pointer types like Box<T> are built from more primi- tive types that live deeper within Rust, often in its core or alloc modules. Addition- ally, the C++ smart pointer types have Rust counterparts. Here are some useful starting points for you when building your own smart pointer types: \\uf0a1 core::ptr::Unique is the basis for types such as String, Box<T>, and the pointer field Vec<T>. \\uf0a1 core::ptr::Shared is the basis for Rc<T> and Arc<T>, and it can handle situa- tions where shared access is desired. In addition, the following tools can also be handy in certain situations: \\uf0a1Deeply interlinked data structures can benefit from std::rc::Weak and std::arc:: Weak for single and multi-threaded programs, respectively. These allow access to data within an Rc/Arc without incrementing its reference count. This can prevent never-ending cycles of pointers. \\uf0a1The alloc::raw_vec::RawVec type underlies Vec<T> and VecDeq<T>. An expand- able, double-ended queue that hasn’t appeared in the book so far, it under- stands how to allocate and deallocate memory in a smart way for any given type. \\uf0a1The std::cell::UnsafeCell type sits behind both Cell<T> and RefCell<T>. If you would like to provide interior mutability to your types, its implementation is worth investigating. A full treatment of building new safe pointers touches on some of Rust’s internals. These building blocks have their own building blocks. Unfortunately, explaining every detail will diverge too far from our goals for this chapter. NOTE Inquisitive readers should investigate the source code of the standard library’s pointer types. For example, the std::cell::RefCell type is docu- mented at https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html.

Think of a stack of dinner plates waiting in the cupboard of a commercial kitchen. Cooks are taking plates off the stack to serve food, and dishwashers are placing new plates on the top.  The unit (the plate) of a computing stack is the stack frame, also known as the allo- cation record. You are probably used to thinking of this as a group of variables and other data. Like many descriptions in computing, the stack and the heap are analogies that only partially fit. Even though the stack is often compared by analogy to a stack of din- ner plates waiting in the cupboard, unfortunately, that mental picture is inaccurate. Here are some differences: \\uf0a1The stack actually contains two levels of objects: stack frames and data. \\uf0a1The stack grants programmers access to multiple elements stored within it, rather than the top item only. \\uf0a1The stack can include elements of arbitrary size, where the implication of the dinner plate analogy is that all elements must be of the same size. So why is the stack called the stack? Because of the usage pattern. Entries on the stack are made in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.  The entries in the stack are called stack frames. Stack frames are created as function calls are made. As a program progresses, a cursor within the CPU updates to reflect the current address of the current stack frame. The cursor is known as the stack pointer.  As functions are called within functions, the stack pointer decreases in value as the stack grows. When a function returns, the stack pointer increases.  Stack frames contain a function’s state during the call. When a function is called within a function, the older function’s values are effectively frozen in time. Stack frames are also known as activation frames, and less commonly allocation records.1  Unlike dinner plates, every stack frame is a different size. The stack frame contains space for its function’s arguments, a pointer to the original call site, and local vari- ables (except the data which is allocated on the heap). NOTE If you are unfamiliar with what the term call site means, see the CPU emulation section in chapter 5. To understand what is happening more fully, let’s consider a thought experiment. Imagine a diligent, yet absurdly single-minded cook in a commercial kitchen. The cook takes each table’s docket and places those in a queue. The cook has a fairly bad memory, so each current order is written down a notebook. As new orders come in, 1 To be precise, the activation frame is called a stack frame when allocated on the stack.',\n",

Hopefully, you will not be one of the early orders during tomorrow’s lunch rush.  In this analogy, the notebook plays the role of the stack pointer. The stack itself is comprised of variable-length dockets, representing stack frames. Like stack frames, restaurant dockets contain some metadata. For example, the table number can act as the return address.  The stack’s primary role is to make space for local variables. Why is the stack fast? All of a function’s variables are side by side in memory. That speeds up access. Improving the ergonomics of functions that can only accept String or &str As a library author, it can simplify downstream application code if your functions can accept both &str and String types. Unfortunately, these two types have different representations in memory. One (&str) is allocated on the stack, the other (String) allocates memory on the heap. That means that types cannot be trivially cast between one another. It’s possible, however, to work around this with Rust’s generics. Consider the example of validating a password. For the purposes of the example, a strong password is one that’s at least 6 characters long. The following shows how to validate the password by checking its length: fn is_strong(password: String) -> bool {     password.len() > 5 } is_strong can only accept String. That means that the following code won’t work: let pw = \"justok\"; let is_strong = is_strong(pw); But generic code can help. In cases where read-only access is required, use functions with the type signature fn x<T: AsRef<str>> (a: T) rather than fn x(a: String). The fairly unwieldy type signature reads “as function x takes an argument password of type T, where T implements AsRef<str>.” Implementors of AsRef<str> behave as a reference to str even when these are not. Here is the code snippet again for the previous listing, accepting any type T that implements AsRef<str>. It now has the new signature in place: fn is_strong<T: AsRef<str>>(password: T) -> bool {       password.as_ref().len() > 5 } When read-write access to the argument is required, normally you can make use of AsRef<T>\\'s sibling trait AsMut<T>.

What does it mean to have no known size at compile time? In Rust, there are two meanings. Some types grow and shrink over time as required. Obvious cases are String and Vec<T>. Other types are unable to tell the Rust compiler how much mem- ory to allocate even though these don’t change size at runtime. These are known as dynamically sized types. Slices ([T]) are the commonly cited example. Slices have no compile-time length. Internally, these are a pointer to some part of an array. But slices actually represent some number of elements within that array.  Another example is a trait object, which we’ve not described in this book so far. Trait objects allow Rust programmers to mimic some features of dynamic languages by allowing multiple types to be wedged into the same container. WHAT IS THE HEAP? You will gain a fuller understanding of what the heap is once you work through the next section on virtual memory. For now, let’s concentrate on what it is not. Once those points are clarified, we’ll then work our way back toward some form of truth.  The word “heap” implies disorganization. A closer analogy would be warehouse space in some medium-sized business. As deliveries arrive (as variables are created), the warehouse makes space available. As the business carries out its work, those mate- rials are used, and the warehouse space can now be made available for new deliveries. At times, there are gaps and perhaps a bit of clutter. But overall, there is a good sense of order.  Another mistake is that the heap has no relationship to the data structure that is also known as a heap. That data structure is often used to create priority queues. It’s an incredibly clever tool in its own right, but right now it’s a complete distraction. The heap is not a data structure. It’s an area of memory. (continued) It’s possible to ask Rust to accept only those types that can be converted to String. The following example performs that conversion within the function and applies any required business logic to that newly created String. This can circumvent the issue of &str being an immutable value. fn is_strong<T: Into<String>>(password: T) -> bool {     password.into().len() > 5 } This implicit conversion strategy does have significant risks, though. If a string-ified version of the password variable needs to be created multiple times in the pipeline, it would be much more efficient to require an explicit conversion within the calling application. That way the String would be created once and reused.',\n",

The critical difference from a usage point of view is that variables on the heap must be accessed via a pointer, whereas this is not required with variables accessed on the stack.  Although it’s a trivial example, let’s consider two variables, a and b. These both represent the integers 40 and 60, respectively. In one of those cases though, the inte- ger happens to live on the heap, as in this example: let a: i32 = 40; let b: Box<i32> = Box::new(60); Now, let’s demonstrate that critical difference. The following code won’t compile: let result = a + b; The boxed value assigned to b is only accessible via a pointer. To access that value, we need to dereference it. The dereference operator is a unary *, which prefixes the vari- able name: let result = a + *b; This syntax can be difficult to follow at first because the symbol is also used for multi- plication. It does, however, become more natural over time. The following listing shows a complete example where creating variables on the heap implies constructing that variable via a pointer type such as Box<T>. fn main() {     let a: i32 = 40;                 let b: Box<i32> = Box::new(60);         println!(\"{} + {} = {}\", a, b, a + *b);     } To get a feel for what the heap is and what is happening within memory as a program runs, let’s consider a tiny example. In this example, all we will do is to create some numbers on the heap and then add their values together. When run, the program in listing 6.7 produces some fairly trivial output: two 3s.

Box is a term that can be deceptive if you don’t share its intuition. Something that has been boxed lives on the heap, with a pointer to it on the stack.

Types that implement Drop have a drop() method, but explicitly calling it is illegal within user code. std::mem::drop is an escape hatch from that rule. \\uf0a1Asterisks next to variables (*a, *b, *c, and *d) are unary operators. This is the derefer- ence operator. Dereferencing a Box::(T) returns T. In our case, the variables a, b, c, and d are references that refer to integers.

When the program would like more memory, it needs to ask for more from the OS. This is known as dynamic memory allocation and is shown in figure 6.6. Dynamic memory allocation is a three-step process: 1 Request memory from the OS via a system call. In the UNIX family of operating systems, this system call is alloc(). In MS Windows, the call is HeapAlloc(). 2 Make use of the allocated memory in the program. 3 Release memory that isn’t needed back to the OS via free() for UNIX systems and HeapFree() for Windows. As it turns out, there is an intermediary between the program and the OS: the alloca- tor, a specialist subprogram that is embedded in your program behind the scenes. It will often perform optimizations that avoid lots of work within the OS and CPU.  Let’s examine the performance impact of dynamic memory allocation and strate- gies to reduce that impact. Before starting, let’s recap why there’s a performance dif- ference between the stack and the heap. Remember that the stack and the heap are conceptual abstractions only. These do not exist as physical partitions of your com- puter’s memory. What accounts for their different performance characteristics?  Accessing data on the stack is fast because a function’s local variables, which are allocated on the stack, reside next to each other in RAM. This is sometimes referred to as a contiguous layout.  A contiguous layout is cache-friendly. Alternatively, variables allocated on the heap are unlikely to reside next to each other. Moreover, accessing data on the heap involves dereferencing the pointer. That implies a page table lookup and a trip to main memory. Table 6.1 summarizes these differences. Figure 6.6 Conceptual view of dynamic memory allocation. Requests  for memory originate and terminate at the program level but involve  several other components. At each stage, the components may short- circuit the process and return quickly.

If a program reports 100 KB of RAM usage, it would seem that n would be somewhere near 100,000. Let’s test that intuition.  We’ll create a small command-line program that looks through memory, start- ing at location 0 and ending at 10,000. As it’s a small program, it shouldn’t occupy more than 10,000 bytes. But when executed, the program will not perform as intended. Sadly, it will crash. You’ll learn why the crash occurs as you follow through this section.  Listing 6.12 shows the command-line program. You can find its source in ch6/ch6- memscan-1/src/main.rs. The listing scans through a running program’s memory byte by byte, starting at 0. It introduces the syntax for creating raw pointers and derefer- encing (reading) those.  1 fn main() {  2     let mut n_nonzero = 0;  3   4     for i in 0..10000 {  5         let ptr = i as *const u8;      6         let byte_at_addr = unsafe { *ptr };     7   8         if byte_at_addr != 0 {  9             n_nonzero += 1; 10         } 11     } 12  13     println!(\"non-zero bytes in memory: {}\", n_nonzero); 14 } \\uf0a1Segment—A block within virtual memory. Virtual memory is divided into blocks to minimize the space required to translate between virtual and physical addresses. \\uf0a1Segmentation fault—An error raised by the CPU when an illegal memory address is requested. \\uf0a1MMU—A component of the CPU that manages memory address translation. Maintains a cache of recently translated addresses (called the TLB), which stands for the translation lookaside buffer, although that terminology has fallen from fashion. One term that has not been defined in any technical sense so far in this book is process. If you’ve encountered it before and have been wondering why it has been omitted, it will be introduced properly when we talk about concurrency. For now, con- sider the terms process and its peer operating system process to refer to a running program.  Listing 6.12 Attempting to scan a running program’s memory byte by byte Converts i to a *const T, a raw pointer  of type u8 to inspect raw memory  addresses. We treat every address as  a unit, ignoring the fact that most  values span multiple bytes. Dereferences the pointer, it  reads the value at address i.  Another way of saying this  is “read the value being  pointed to.”',\n",

Incidentally, this is why all raw pointer dereferences must occur within an unsafe block.  How about we attempt to start from a non-zero memory address? Given that the program is executable code, there should be at least several thousand bytes of non- zero data to iterate through. The following listing scans the process’s memory starting from 1 to avoid dereferencing a NULL pointer.  1 fn main() {  2     let mut n_nonzero = 0;  3   4     for i in 1..10000 {       5         let ptr = i as *const u8;  6         let byte_at_addr = unsafe { *ptr };  7   8         if byte_at_addr != 0 {  9             n_nonzero += 1; 10         } 11     } 12  13     println!(\"non-zero bytes in memory: {}\", n_nonzero); 14 } This unfortunately does not completely solve the issue.

That explains the name.  Let’s try a different approach. Rather than attempting to scan through bytes, let’s look for the addresses of things that we know exist.

For every running program, every virtual address is mapped to a physical address. Those instructions are stored at a predefined address in memory as well. That means, in the worst case, every attempt at accessing memory addresses incurs two memory lookups. But it’s possible to avoid the worst case.  The CPU maintains a cache of recently translated addresses. It has its own (fast) memory to speed up accessing memory. For historic reasons, this cache is known as the translation lookaside buffer, often abbreviated as TLB. Programmers optimizing for performance need to keep data structures lean and avoid deeply nested structures. Reaching the capacity of the TLB (typically around 100 pages for x86 processors) can be costly.  Looking into how the translation system operates reveals more, often quite com- plex, details. Virtual addresses are grouped into blocks called pages, which are typically 4 KB in size. This practice avoids the need to store a translation mapping for every single variable in every program. Having a uniform size for each page also assists in avoiding a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation, where pockets of empty, yet unusable, space appear within available RAM. NOTE This is a general guide only. The details of how the OS and CPU coop- erate to manage memory differs significantly in some environments. In par- ticular, constrained environments such as microcontrollers can use real addressing. For those interested in learning more, the research field is known as computer architecture. The OS and CPU can play some interesting tricks when data lives within pages of vir- tual memory. For example \\uf0a1Having a virtual address space allows the OS to overallocate. Programs that ask for more memory than the machine can physically provide are able to be accommodated. \\uf0a1Inactive memory pages can be swapped to disk in a byte-for-byte manner until it’s requested by the active program. Swapping is often used during periods of high contention for memory but can be used more generally, depending on an operating system’s whims. \\uf0a1Other size optimizations such as compression can be performed. A program sees its memory intact. Behind the scenes, the OS compresses the program’s wasteful data usage. \\uf0a1Programs are able to share data quickly. If your program requests a large block of zeroes, say, for a newly created array, the OS might point you towards a page filled with zeroes that is currently being used by three other programs. None of the programs are aware that the others are looking at the same physical mem- ory, and the zeroes have different positions within their virtual address space.',\n",

As a special case of the previ- ous point, if a shared library is already loaded by another program, the OS can avoid loading it into memory twice by pointing the new program to the old data. \\uf0a1Paging adds security between programs. As you discovered earlier in this section, some parts of the address space are illegal to access. The OS has other attributes that it can add. If an attempt is made to write to a read-only page, the OS termi- nates the program. Making effective use of the virtual memory system in day-to-day programs requires thinking about how data is represented in RAM. Here are some guidelines: \\uf0a1Keep hot working portions of your program within 4 KB of size. This maintains fast lookups. \\uf0a1If 4 KB is unreasonable for your application, then the next target to keep under is 4 KB * 100. That rough guide should mean that the CPU can maintain its translation cache (the TLB) in good order to support your program. \\uf0a1Avoid deeply nested data structures with pointer spaghetti. If a pointer points to another page, then performance suffers. \\uf0a1Test the ordering of your nested loops. CPUs read small blocks of bytes, known as a cache line, from the RAM hardware. When processing an array, you can take advantage of this by investigating whether you are doing column-wise or row- wise operations. One thing to note: virtualization makes this situation worse. If you’re running an app inside a virtual machine, the hypervisor must also translate addresses for its guest operating systems. This is why many CPUs ship with virtualization support, which can reduce this extra overhead. Running containers within virtual machines adds another layer of indirection and, therefore, latency. For bare-metal performance, run apps on bare metal. How does an executable file turn into a program’s virtual address space? The layout of executable files (aka binaries) has many similarities to the address space diagram that we saw earlier in the heap versus stack section of the chapter. While the exact process is dependent on the OS and file format, the following figure shows a representative example. Each of the segments of the address space that we have discussed are described by binary files. When the executable is started, the OS loads the right bytes into the right places. Once the virtual address space is created, the CPU can be told to jump to the start of the .text segment, and the program begins executing.',\n",

To start with, however, let’s see if we can create patterns from the raw byte sequence within files. 7.1 What is a file format? File formats are standards for working with data as an single, ordered sequence of bytes. Storage media like hard disk drives work faster when reading or writing large blocks of data in serial. This contrasts with in-memory data structures, where data lay- out has less of an impact.  File formats live in a large design space with trade-offs in performance, human- readability, and portability. Some formats are highly portable and self-describing. Oth- ers restrict themselves to being accessible within a single environment and are unable to be read by third-party tools, yet they are high performance.  Table 7.1 illustrates some of the design space for file formats. Each row reveals the file format’s internal patterns, which are generated from the same source text. By color-coding each byte within the file, it’s possible to see structural differences between each representation. Table 7.1 The internals of four digital versions of William Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing produced by Project Gutenberg. The plain text version of the play contains printable char- acters only. These are indicated by dark grey for letters  and punctuation, and white for whitespace. Visually, the image appears to be noisy. It lacks internal  structure. That’s due to the variation in length of the natu- ral language that the file represents. A file with regular,  repeating structures, such as a file format designed to  hold arrays of floating-point numbers, tends to look quite  different. The EPUB format is actually a compressed ZIP archive  with a bespoke file extension. There are many bytes  within the file that fall out of the range of the printable  category as indicated by the mid-grey pixels. MOBI includes four bands of NULL bytes (0x00), repre- sented as black pixels. These bands probably represent  the result of an engineering trade-off. In some sense,  these empty bytes are wasted space. They’re probably  added as padding so that the file’s sections are easy to  parse later on. The other notable feature of this file is its size. It’s larger  than the other versions of the play. This might imply that  the file is harboring more data than just the text. Candi- dates include display elements like fonts, or encryption  keys that enforce anti-copying restrictions within the file.',\n",

Despite this, many systems use plain text files for data storage. Configuration files, for example, are commonly designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable. The Rust ecosystem has excellent support for converting data to many on-disk formats. 7.2.1 Writing data to disk with serde and the bincode format The serde crate serializes and deserializes Rust values to and from many formats. Each format has its own strengths: many are human-readable, while others prefer to be compact so that they can be speedily sent across the network.  Using serde takes surprisingly little ceremony. As an example, let’s use statistics about the Nigerian city of Calabar and store those in multiple output formats. To start, let’s assume that our code contains a City struct. The serde crate provides the Serialize and Deserialize traits, and most code implements these with this derived annotation: #[derive(Serialize)]     struct City {     name: String,     population: usize,     latitude: f64,     longitude: f64, } Populating that struct with data about Calabar is straightforward.

Table 7.2 provides an example. As you know from previous chapters, two hexadecimal numbers can represent all digits from 0 to 255, which is the number of bit patterns representable within a single byte. We’ll call our clone fview (short for file view). Unless you’re familiar with hexadecimal notation, the output from fview can be fairly opaque. If you’re experienced at looking at similar output, you may notice that there are no bytes above 0x7e (127). There are also few bytes less than 0x21 (33), with the exception of 0x0a (10). Ox0a represents the newline character (\\\\n). These byte pat- terns are markers for a plain text input source.  Listing 7.4 provides the source code that builds the complete fview. But because a few new features of Rust need to be introduced, we’ll take a few steps to get to the full program.  We’ll start with listing 7.3, which uses a string literal as input and produces the out- put in table 7.2. It demonstrates the use of multiline string literals, importing the std::io traits via std::io::prelude. This enables &[u8] types to be read as files via the std::io::Read trait. The source for this listing is in ch7/ch7-fview-str/src/main.rs.  1 use std::io::prelude::*;        2   3 const BYTES_PER_LINE: usize = 16;  4 const INPUT: &\\'static [u8] = br#\"      5 fn main() {  6     println!(\"Hello, world!\");  7 }\"#;  8   9 fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> { Table 7.2 fview in operation fview input fn main() { println!(\"Hello, world!\"); } fview output [0x00000000] 0a 66 6e 20 6d 61 69 6e 28 29 20 7b 0a 20 20 20 [0x00000010] 20 70 72 69 6e 74 6c 6e 21 28 22 48 65 6c 6c 6f [0x00000020] 2c 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21 22 29 3b 0a 7d Listing 7.3 A hexdump clone with hard-coded input that mocks file I/O prelude imports heavily used traits such as  Read and Write in I/O operations.

Let’s look at some of those constructs now: \\uf0a1 while let Ok(_) { … }— With this control-flow structure, the program con- tinues to loop until f.read_exact() returns Err, which occurs when it has run out of bytes to read. \\uf0a1 f.read_exact()—This method from the Read trait transfers data from the source (in our case, f) to the buffer provided as an argument. It stops when that buffer is full. f.read_exact() provides greater control to you as a programmer for managing memory than the chunks() option used in listing 7.3, but it comes with some quirks. If the buffer is longer than the number of available bytes to read, the file returns an error, and the state of the buffer is undefined. Listing 7.4 also includes some stylistic additions: \\uf0a1To handle command-line arguments without using third-party libraries, we make use of std::env::args(). It returns an iterator over the arguments provided to the program. Iterators have an nth() method, which extracts the element at the nth position. \\uf0a1Every iterator’s nth() method returns an Option. When n is larger than the length of the iterator, None is returned. To handle these Option values, we use calls to expect(). \\uf0a1The expect() method is considered a friendlier version of unwrap(). expect() takes an error message as an argument, whereas unwrap() simply panics abruptly. Using std::env::args() directly means that input is not validated. That’s a problem in our simple example, but is something to consider for larger programs.  7.4 File operations in Rust So far in this chapter, we have invested a lot of time considering how data is translated into sequences of bytes. Let’s spend some time considering another level of abstrac- tion—the file. Previous chapters have covered basic operations like opening and read- ing from a file. This section contains some other helpful techniques, which provide more granular control. 7.4.1 Opening a file in Rust and controlling its file mode Files are an abstraction that’s maintained by the operating system (OS). It presents a façade of names and hierarchy above a nest of raw bytes.  Files also provide a layer of security. These have attached permissions that the OS enforces. This (in principle, at least) is what prevents a web server running under its own user account from reading files owned by others.  std::fs::File is the primary type for interacting with the filesystem. There are two methods available for creating a file: open() and create(). Use open() when you know the file already exists. Table 7.3 explains more of their differences.',\n",

NOTE As an implementation detail, std::fs::Path and std::fs::PathBuf are implemented on top of std::ffi::OsStr and std::ffi::OsString, respec- tively. This means that Path and PathBuf are not guaranteed to be UTF-8 compliant. Why use Path rather than manipulating strings directly? Here are some good reasons for using Path: \\uf0a1Clear intent—Path provides useful methods like set_extension() that describe the intended outcome. This can assist programmers who later read the code. Manipulating strings doesn’t provide that level of self-documentation. \\uf0a1Portability—Some operating systems treat filesystem paths as case-insensitive. Others don’t. Using one operating system’s conventions can result in issues later, when users expect their host system’s conventions to be followed. Addi- tionally, path separators are specific to operating systems and, thus, can differ. This means that using raw strings can lead to portability issues. Comparisons require exact matches. \\uf0a1Easier debugging—If you’re attempting to extract /tmp from the path /tmp/ hello.txt, doing it manually can introduce subtle bugs that may only appear at runtime. Further, miscounting the correct number of index values after split- ting the string on / introduces a bug that can’t be caught at compile time.

Let’s begin to lift the lid on database technology. Along the way, we’ll learn the internal architecture of a family of database systems using a log-structured, append-only model.  Log-structured, append-only database systems are significant as case studies because these are designed to be extremely resilient while offering optimal read performance. Despite storing data on fickle media like flash storage or a spinning hard disk drive, databases using this model are able to guarantee that data will never be lost and that backed up data files will never be corrupted. 7.5.1 The key-value model The key-value store implemented in this chapter, actionkv, stores and retrieves sequences of bytes ([u8]) of arbitrary length. Each sequence has two parts: the first is a key and the second is a value. Because the &str type is represented as [u8] internally, table 7.5 shows the plain text notation rather than the binary equivalent. The key-value model enables simple queries such as “What is the capital city of Fiji?” But it doesn’t support asking broader queries such as “What is the list of capital cities for all Pacific Island states?” 7.5.2 Introducing actionkv v1: An in-memory key-value store with a  command-line interface The first version of our key-value store, actionkv, exposes us to the API that we’ll use throughout the rest of the chapter and also introduces the main library code. The library code will not change as the subsequent two systems are built on top of it. Before we get to that code, though, there are some prerequisites that need to be covered. The plain String code lets you use familiar methods,  but it can introduce subtle bugs that are difficult to detect  at compile time. In this instance, we’ve used the wrong  index number to access the parent directory (/tmp). Using path::Path doesn’t make your code immune to  subtle errors, but it can certainly help to minimize their  likelihood. Path provides dedicated methods for com- mon operations such as setting a file’s extension.

Table 7.6 describes these operations. The following listing, an excerpt from listing 7.8, shows the naming considerations mentioned in the preceding sidebar. For our project, we use Rust’s matching facilities to efficiently work with the command-line arguments and to dispatch to the correct internal function.

Generally, this is the target’s OS but can be facilities provided by its CPU. Changing what is compiled depending on some compile-time condition is known as conditional compilation.  To add conditional compilation to your project, annotate your source code with cfg attributes. cfg works in conjunction with the target parameter provided to rustc during compilation.  Listing 7.8 provides a usage string common as quick documentation for command- line utilities for multiple operating systems. It’s replicated in the following listing, which uses conditional compilation to provide two definitions of const USAGE in the code. When the project is built for Windows, the usage string contains a .exe file extension. The resulting binary files include only the data that is relevant for their target.  3 #[cfg(target_os = \"windows\")]  4 const USAGE: &str = \"  5 Usage:  6     akv_mem.exe FILE get KEY Listing 7.9 Demonstrating the use of conditional compilation',\n",

It is an implementa- tion of the Bitcask storage backend that was developed for the original implementa- tion of the Riak database. Bitcask belongs to a family of file formats known in the literature as Log-Structured Hash Tables. What is EOF? File operations in Rust might return an error of type std::io::ErrorKind:: UnexpectedEof, but what is Eof? The end of file (EOF) is a convention that operating systems provide to applications. There is no special marker or delimiter at the end of a file within the file itself. EOF is a zero byte (0u8). When reading from a file, the OS tells the application how many bytes were successfully read from storage. If no bytes were successfully read from disk, yet no error condition was detected, then the OS and, therefore, the appli- cation assume that EOF has been reached. This works because the OS has the responsibility for interacting with physical devices. When a file is read by an application, the application notifies the OS that it would like to access the disk.  What is Riak? Riak, a NoSQL database, was developed during the height of the NoSQL movement and competed against similar systems such as MongoDB, Apache CouchDB, and Tokyo Tyrant. It distinguished itself with its emphasis on resilience to failure. Although it was slower than its peers, it guaranteed that it never lost data. That guar- antee was enabled in part because of its smart choice of a data format. Unexpected is relative. The  application might not have  expected to encounter the  end of the file, but we expect  files to be finite, so we’ll deal  with that eventuality.',\n",

The process_record() function does the processing for this within ActionKV.

This sounds easy, but computing platforms differ as to how numbers are read. Some read the 4 bytes of an i32 from left to right; others read from right to left. That could potentially be a problem if the program is designed to be writ- ten by one computer and loaded by another.  The Rust ecosystem provides some support here. The byteorder crate can extend types that implement the standard library’s std::io::Read and std::io::Write traits. std::io::Read and std::io::Write are commonly associated with std::io::File but are also implemented by other types such as [u8] and TcpStream. The exten- sions can guarantee how multi-byte sequences are interpreted, either as little endian or big endian.  To follow what’s going on with our key-value store, it will help to have an under- standing of how byteorder works. Listing 7.14 is a toy application that demonstrates the core functionality. Lines 11–23 show how to write to a file and lines 28–35 show how to read from one. The two key lines are use byteorder::{LittleEndian}; use byteorder::{ReadBytesExt, WriteBytesExt}; byteorder::LittleEndian and its peers BigEndian and NativeEndian (not used in listing 7.14) are types that declare how multi-byte data is written to and read from disk. byteorder::ReadBytesExt and byteorder::WriteBytesExt are traits. In some sense, these are invisible within the code.  These extend methods to primitive types such as f32 and i16 without further cere- mony. Bringing those into scope with a use statement immediately adds powers to the types that are implemented within the source of byteorder (in practice, that means primitive types).

Then compare the results of the two checking func- tions. If the two results do not match, an error has occurred, and the data should be considered corrupted. Which checking function should you use?

More traditional areas might see the use of simpler systems, such as a parity bit or CRC32. IMPLEMENTING PARITY BIT CHECKING This section describes one of the simpler checksum schemes: parity checking. Parity checks count the number of 1s within a bitstream. These store a bit that indicates whether the count was even or odd.  Parity bits are traditionally used for error detection within noisy communication systems, such as transmitting data over analog systems such as radio waves. For exam- ple, the ASCII encoding of text has a particular property that makes it quite conve- nient for this scheme. Its 128 characters only require 7 bits of storage (128 = 27). That leaves 1 spare bit in every byte.  Systems can also include parity bits in larger streams of bytes. Listing 7.15 presents an (overly chatty) implementation. The parity_bit() function in lines 1–10 takes an arbitrary stream of bytes and returns a u8, indicating whether the count of the input’s bits was even or odd. When executed, listing 7.15 produces the following output: input: [97, 98, 99]             97 (0b01100001) has 3 one bits 98 (0b01100010) has 3 one bits 99 (0b01100011) has 4 one bits output: 00000001 input: [97, 98, 99, 100]        97 (0b01100001) has 3 one bits 98 (0b01100010) has 3 one bits 99 (0b01100011) has 4 one bits 100 (0b01100100) has 3 one bits result: 00000000 NOTE The code for the following listing is in ch7/ch7-paritybit/src/main.rs.

In this book, the terms collection of key-value pairs and associative array refer to the abstract data type. Hash table refers to associative arrays implemented with a hash table, and a HashMap refers to Rust’s implementation of hash tables. What is a hash? What is hashing? If you’ve ever been confused by the term hash, it may help to understand that this relates to an implementation decision made to enable non-integer keys to map to val- ues.

In prac- tice, the return value of a hash function is an integer. That fixed-width value can then be used to build an efficient lookup table. This internal lookup table is known as a hash table. The following example shows a basic hash function for &str that simply interprets the first character of a string as an unsigned integer. It, therefore, uses the first char- acter of the string as an hash value: fn basic_hash(key: &str) -> u32 {     let first = key.chars()                           .next()                        .unwrap_or('\\\\0');         unsafe {                                              std::mem::transmute::<char, u32>(first)       }                                             } The .chars() iterator converts  the string into a series of char  values, each 4 bytes long.

That’s great! But, although basic_hash is fast, it has some significant faults. If multiple inputs start with the same character (for example, Tonga and Tuvalu), these result in the same output. This happens in every instance when an infinite input space is mapped into a finite space, but it’s particularly bad here. Natural language text is not uniformly distributed. Hash tables, including Rust’s HashMap, deal with this phenomenon, which is called a hash collision. These provide a backup location for keys with the same hash value. That secondary storage is typically a Vec<T> that we’ll call the collision store. When collisions occur, the collision store is scanned from front to back when it is accessed.

There are two ways to achieve this. To demonstrate, let’s assume that we have initial- ized capitals from listing 7.19. The approach (already demonstrated) is to access val- ues via square brackets: capitals[\"Tonga\"]    Listing 7.19 Including JSON literals with serde-json Type declarations of keys and  values are not required here  as these are inferred by the  Rust compiler. HashMap implements Index,  which allows for values to  be retrieved via the square  bracket indexing style.

Lower levels receive a stream of bytes and pass it on. Higher levels don’t care how messages are sent; they just want them sent.  Let’s consider one example: HTTP. HTTP is known as an application-level protocol. Its job is to transport content like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebAssembly modules, images, video, and other formats. These formats often include other embedded for- mats via compression and encoding standards. HTTP itself often redundantly includes information provided by one of the layers below it, TCP. Between HTTP and TCP sits TLS. TLS (Transport Layer Security), which has replaced SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), adds the S to HTTPS.  TLS provides encrypted messaging over an unencrypted connection. TLS is imple- mented on top of TCP. TCP sits upon many other protocols. These go all the way down to specifying how voltages should be interpreted as 0s and 1s. And yet, as complicated as this story is so far, it gets worse. These layers, as you have probably seen in your dealings with those as a computer user, bleed together like watercolor paint.  HTML includes a mechanism to supplement or overwrite directives omitted or specified within HTTP: the <meta> tag’s http-equiv attribute. HTTP can make adjust- ments downwards to TCP. The “Connection: keep-alive” HTTP header instructs TCP to maintain its connection after this HTTP message has been received. These sorts of interactions occur all through the stack. Figure 8.2 provides one view of the network- ing stack. It is more complicated than most attempts. And even that complicated pic- ture is highly simplified.  Despite all of that, we’re going to try to implement as many layers as possible within a single chapter. By the end of it, you will be sending HTTP requests with a vir- tual networking device and a minimal TCP implementation that you created yourself, using a DNS resolver that you also created yourself.  8.2 Generating an HTTP GET request with reqwest Our first implementation will be with a high-level library that is focused on HTTP. We’ll use the reqwest library because its focus is primarily on making it easy for Rust programmers to create an HTTP request.  Although it’s the shortest, the reqwest implementation is the most feature-complete. As well as being able to correctly interpret HTTP headers, it also handles cases like content redirects. Most importantly, it understands how to handle TLS properly.  In addition to expanded networking capabilities, reqwest also validates the con- tent’s encoding and ensures that it is sent to your application as a valid String. None of our lower-level implementations do any of that. The following shows the project structure for listing 8.2: ch8-simple/ ├── src │  └── main.rs └── Cargo.toml',\n",

You will also develop the world’s next best-selling fantasy role-playing game—the rpg project. If you would like to focus on networking, feel free to skip ahead to section 8.4.  There is a reasonable amount of jargon in the next several paragraphs. Brace your- self. You’ll do fine. Let’s start by introducing trait objects by what they achieve and what they do, rather than focusing on what they are. 8.3.1 What do trait objects enable? While trait objects have several uses, they are immediately helpful by allowing you to create containers of multiple types. Although players of our role-playing game can choose different races, and each race is defined in its own struct, you’ll want to treat those as a single type. A Vec<T> won’t work here because we can’t easily have types T, U, and V wedged into Vec<T> without introducing some type of wrapper object.  8.3.2 What is a trait object? Trait objects add a form of polymorphism—the ability to share an interface between types—to Rust via dynamic dispatch. Trait objects are similar to generic objects. Gener- ics offer polymorphism via static dispatch. Choosing between generics and type objects typically involves a trade off between disk space and time: \\uf0a1Generics use more disk space with faster runtimes. \\uf0a1Trait objects use less disk space but incur a small runtime overhead caused by pointer indirection. Trait objects are dynamically-sized types, which means that these are always seen in the wild behind a pointer. Trait objects appear in three forms: &dyn Trait, &mut dyn Trait, and Box<dyn Trait>.1 The primary difference between the three forms is that Box<dyn Trait> is an owned trait object, whereas the other two are borrowed.  1 In old Rust code, you may see &Trait, and Box<Trait>. While legal syntax, these are officially deprecated. Adding dyn keyword is strongly encouraged.',\n",

In a sense, they provide a way to navigate Rust’s rigid type system. As you learn about this feature in more detail, you will encounter some jargon. For example, trait objects are a form of type erasure. The compiler does not have access to the original type during the call to enchant(). Trait vs. type One of the frustrating things about Rust’s syntax for beginners is that trait objects and type parameters look similar. But types and traits are used in different places. For example, consider these two lines: use rand::Rng; use rand::rngs::ThreadRng; Although these both have something to do with random number generators, they’re quite different. rand::Rng is a trait; rand::rngs::ThreadRng is a struct. Trait objects make this distinction harder. When used as a function argument and in similar places, the form &dyn Rng is a ref- erence to something that implements the Rng trait, whereas &ThreadRng is a refer- ence to a value of ThreadRng. With time, the distinction between traits and types becomes easier to grasp. Here’s some common use cases for trait objects: Dwarves are poor  spellcasters, and their  spells regularly fail. Spells cast by  elves rarely fail. Humans are proficient  at enchanting things.  Mistakes are  uncommon. We can hold members of dif- ferent types within the same Vec as all these implement the Enchanter trait.',\n",

Put another way, UDP does not support two-way (duplex) communications. But DNS requires a response to be sent from the DNS server back to the client. To enable two-way communications within UDP, both parties must act as clients and servers, depending on context. That context is defined by the protocol built on top of UDP.

Multiple error types in one function prevent returning Result. The first strategy we looked at was to use trait objects, but trait objects have a potentially significant downside.  Using trait objects is also known as type erasure. Rust is no longer aware that an error has originated upstream. Using Box<dyn Error> as the error variant of a Result means that the upstream error types are, in a sense, lost. The original errors are now converted to exactly the same type.  It is possible to retain the upstream errors, but this requires more work on our behalf. We need to bundle upstream errors in our own type. When the upstream errors are needed later (say, for reporting errors to the user), it’s possible to extract these with pattern matching. Here is the process: 1 Define an enum that includes the upstream errors as variants. 2 Annotate the enum with #[derive(Debug)]. 3 Implement Display. 4 Implement Error, which almost comes for free because we have implemented Debug and Display. 5 Use map_err() in your code to convert the upstream error to your omnibus error type. NOTE You haven’t previously encountered the map_err() function. We’ll explain what it does when we get there later in this section. It’s possible to stop with the previous steps, but there’s an optional extra step that improves the ergonomics. We need to implement std::convert::From to remove the need to call map_err().

The distinction is made when a device makes a decision about whether to accept a frame. A frame is a term used by the Ethernet protocol for a byte slice at this level. Analogies to frame include a packet, wrapper, and envelope. Figure 8.4 shows this distinction. Unicast addresses are intended to transport information between two points that are in direct contact (say, between a laptop and a router). Wireless access points complicate matters somewhat but don’t change the fundamentals. A multicast address can be accepted by multiple recipients, whereas unicast has a single recipient. The term unicast is somewhat misleading, though. Sending an Ethernet packet involves more than two devices. Using a unicast address alters what devices do when they receive packets but not which data is transmitted over the wire (or through the radio waves). 8.6.1 Generating MAC addresses When we begin talking about raw TCP in section 8.8, we’ll create a virtual hardware device in listing 8.22. To convince anything to talk to us, we need to learn how to assign our virtual device a MAC address. The macgen project in listing 8.17 generates Unicast vs. multicast MAC addresses >_ Sender includes destination MAC address in a frame. Router broadcasts the destination MAC address to all devices listening on the port included in the frame. Single device accepts the frame. Other devices ignore the frame. Although there are three outbound arrows from the wireless access point, there is only a single RF transmission. Unicast Multicast Multiple devices may accept the frame. Transmission behavior is consistent in both modes. Receiving behavior is mode-speciﬁc. Unicast/multicast is set in the least-signiﬁcant bit of the ﬁrst transmitted byte in a MAC address.

It brings together all the threads from the chapter, is dozens of lines long, and yet is less capable than the request::get(url) call we made in listing 8.2. Hopefully it’s revealed several interesting avenues for you to explore. Perhaps, surprisingly, there are several more networking layers to unwrap. Well done for making your way through a lengthy and challenging chapter.  Summary \\uf0a1Networking is complicated. Standard models such as OSIs are only partially accurate. \\uf0a1Trait objects allow for runtime polymorphism. Typically, programmers prefer generics because trait objects incur a small runtime cost. However, this situation is not always clear-cut. Using trait objects can reduce space because only a single version of each function needs to be compiled. Fewer functions also benefits cache coherence. \\uf0a1Networking protocols are particular about which bytes are used.

The closest open source alternative is CockroachDB (https:// www.cockroachlabs.com/). It relies on the NTP, which can have a (worldwide) latency of approximately dozens of milliseconds. But that doesn’t make it useless. When deployed within a local network, NTP allows computers to agree on the time to within a few milliseconds or less.  On the Rust side of the equation, this chapter invests lots of time interacting with the OS internals. You’ll become more confident with unsafe blocks and with using raw pointers. Readers will become familiar with chrono, the de facto standard crate for high-level time and clock operations. 9.1 Background It’s easy to think that a day has 86,400 seconds (60 s × 60 min × 24 h = 86,400 s). But the earth’s rotation isn’t quite that perfect. The length of each day fluctuates due to tidal friction with the moon and other effects such as torque at the boundary of the earth’s core and its mantle.  Software does not tolerate these imperfections. Most systems assume that most sec- onds have an equal duration. The mismatch presents several problems.  In 2012, a large number of services—including high profile sites such as Reddit and Mozilla’s Hadoop infrastructure—stopped functioning after a leap second was added to their clocks. And, at times, clocks can go back in time (this chapter does not, however, cover time travel). Few software systems are prepared for the same time- stamp to appear twice. That makes it difficult to debug the logs. There are two options for resolving this impasse: \\uf0a1Keep the length of each second fixed. This is good for computers but irritating for humans. Over time, “midday” drifts towards sunset or sunrise. \\uf0a1Adjust the length of each year to keep the sun’s position relative to noon in the same place from year to year. This is good for humans but sometimes highly irritating for computers. In practice, we can chose both options as we do in this chapter. The world’s atomic clocks use their own time zone with fixed-length seconds, called TAI. Everything else uses time zones that are periodically adjusted; these are called UTC.  TAI is used by the world’s atomic clocks and maintains a fixed-length year. UTC adds leap seconds to TAI about once every 18 months. In 1972, TAI and UTC were 10 seconds apart. By 2016, they had drifted to 36 seconds apart.  In addition to the issues with earth’s fickle rotational speed, the physics of your own computer make it challenging to keep accurate time. There are also (at least) two clocks running on your system. One is a battery-powered device, called the real-time clock. The other one is known as system time. System time increments itself based on hardware interrupts provided by the computer’s motherboard. Somewhere in your system, a quartz crystal is oscillating rapidly.',\n",

       "  'text': '296 CHAPTER 9 Time and timekeeping 9.2 Sources of time Computers can’t look at the clock on the wall to determine what time it is. They need to figure it out by themselves. To explain how this happens, let’s consider how digital clocks operate generally, then how computer systems operate given some difficult con- straints, such as operating without power.  Digital clocks consist of two main parts. The first part is some component that ticks at regular intervals. The second part is a pair of counters. One counter increments as ticks occur. The other increments as seconds occur. Determining “now” within digital clocks means comparing the number of seconds against some predetermined starting point. The starting point is known as the epoch.  Embedded hardware aside, when your computer is turned off, a small battery- powered clock continues to run. Its electric charge causes a quartz crystal to oscillate rapidly. The clock measures those oscillations and updates its internal counters. In a running computer, the CPU clock frequency becomes the source of regular ticks. A CPU core operates at a fixed frequency.1 Inside the hardware, a counter can be accessed via CPU instructions and/or by accessing predefined CPU registers.2  Relying on a CPU’s clock can actually cause problems in niche scientific and other high-accuracy domains, such as profiling an application’s behavior. When computers use multiple CPUs, which is especially common in high performance computing, each CPU has a slightly different clock rate. Moreover, CPUs perform out-of-order execution. This means that it’s impossible for someone creating a benchmarking/ profiling software suite to know how long a function takes between two timestamps. The CPU instructions requesting the current timestamp may have shifted.  9.3 Definitions Unfortunately, this chapter needs to introduce some jargon: \\uf0a1Absolute time—Describes the time that you would tell someone if they were to ask for the time.

The following listing, an excerpt from listing 9.7, demonstrates how to produce timestamps using the func- tionality provided by chrono. The timestamps are then sent to stdout. 48     let now = Clock::get(); 49     match std { 50         \"timestamp\" => println!(\"{}\", now.timestamp()), 51         \"rfc2822\"   => println!(\"{}\", now.to_rfc2822()), 52         \"rfc3339\"   => println!(\"{}\", now.to_rfc3339()), 53         _ => unreachable!(), 54     } Our clock application (thanks to chrono) supports three time formats—timestamp, rfc2822, and rfc3339: \\uf0a1timestamp—Formats the number of seconds since the epoch, also known as a UNIX timestamp. \\uf0a1rfc2822—Corresponds to RPC 2822 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822), which is how time is formatted within email message headers. \\uf0a1rfc3339—Corresponds to RFC 3339 (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339). RFC 3339 formats time in a way that is more commonly associated with the ISO 8601 standard. However, ISO 8601 is a slightly stricter standard. Every RFC 3339- compliant timestamp is an ISO 8601-compliant timestamp, but the inverse is not true.  9.6.3 Providing a full command-line interface Command-line arguments are part of the environment provided to an application from its OS when it’s established. These are raw strings. Rust provides some support for accessing the raw Vec<String> via std::env::args, but it can be tedious to develop lots of parsing logic for moderately-sized applications.  Our code wants to be able to validate certain input, such that the desired output format is one that the clock app actually supports. But validating input tends to be irri- tatingly complex. To avoid this frustration, clock makes use of the clap crate.  There are two main types that are useful for getting started: clap::App and clap::Arg. Each clap::Arg represents a command-line argument and the options that it can represent. clap::App collects these into a single application. To support the public API in table 9.1, the code in listing 9.5 uses three Arg structs that are wrapped together within a single App.  Listing 9.5 is an excerpt from listing 9.7.

These both follow a common pattern: 1 Parsing a command-line argument to create a DateTime<FixedOffset> value. The FixedOffset time zone is provided by chrono as a proxy for “whichever time zone is provided by the user.” chrono doesn’t know at compile time which time zone will be selected. 2 Converting the DateTime<FixedOffset> to a DateTime<Local> to enable time zone comparisons. 3 Instantiating an OS-specific struct that’s used as an argument for the necessary system call (system calls are function calls provided by the OS). 4 Setting the system’s time within an unsafe block. This block is required because responsibility is delegated to the OS. 5 Printing the updated time. WARNING This code uses functions to teleport the system’s clock to a differ- ent time. This jumpiness can cause system instability. Some applications expect monotonically increasing time. A smarter (but more com- plex) approach is to adjust the length of a second for n seconds until the desired time is reached. Functionality is implemented within the Clock struct that was introduced in section 9.6.1.  9.7.2 Setting the time for operating systems that use libc POSIX-compliant operating systems can have their time set via a call to settimeof- day(), which is provided by libc. libc is the C Standard Library and has lots of historic connections with UNIX operating systems.

This code cheekily, and probably perilously, avoids checking whether the settime- ofday function is successful. It’s quite possible that it isn’t. That will be remedied in the next iteration of the clock application.  9.7.3 Setting the time on MS Windows The code for MS Windows is similar to its libc peers. It is somewhat wordier, as the struct that sets the time has more fields than the second and subsecond part. The rough equivalent of the libc library is called kernel32.dll, which is accessible after including the winapi crate. WINDOWS API INTEGER TYPES Windows provides its own take on what to call integral types. This code only makes use of the WORD type, but it can be useful to remember the two other common types that have emerged since computers have used 16-bit CPUs. The following table shows how integer types from kernel32.dll correspond to Rust types. REPRESENTING TIME IN WINDOWS Windows provides multiple time types. Within our clock application, however, we’re mostly interested in SYSTEMTIME. Another type that is provided is FILETIME. The fol- lowing table describes these types to avoid confusion. Windows type Rust type Remarks WORD u16 Refers to the width of a CPU “word” as it was when Windows was  initially created DWORD u32 Double word QWORD u64 Quadruple word LARGE_INTEGER i64 A type defined as a crutch to enable 32-bit and 64-bit platforms to  share code ULARGE_INTEGER u64 An unsigned version of LARGE_INTEGER  Windows type Rust type Remarks SYSTEMTIME winapi::SYSTEMTIME Contains fields for the year, month, day of the week, day  of the month, hour, minute, second, and millisecond. FILETIME winapi::FILETIME Analogous to libc::timeval. Contains second and  millisecond fields. Microsoft’s documentation warns  that on 64-bit platforms, its use can cause irritating  overflow bugs without finicky type casting, which is why  it’s not employed here.',\n",

There are multiple international standards for synchronizing clocks. This section focuses on the most prominent one—the Network Time Protocol (NTP).  NTP has existed since the mid-1980s, and it has proven to be very stable. Its on-wire format has not changed in the first four revisions of the protocol, with backwards com- patibility retained the entire time. NTP operates in two modes that can loosely be described as always on and request/response.  The always on mode allows multiple computers to work in a peer-to-peer fashion to converge on an agreed definition of now. It requires a software daemon or service to run constantly on each device, but it can achieve tight synchronization within local networks.  The request/response mode is much simpler. Local clients request the time via a single message and then parse the response, keeping track of the elapsed time. The client can then compare the original timestamp with the timestamp sent from the server, alter any delays caused by network latency, and make any necessary adjust- ments to move the local clock towards the server’s time.  Which server should your computer connect to? NTP works by establishing a hier- archy. At the center is a small network of atomic clocks. There are also national pools of servers.  NTP allows clients to request the time from computers that are closer to atomic clocks. But that only gets us part of the way. Let’s say that your computer asks 10 com- puters what they think the time is. Now we have 10 assertions about the time, and the network lag will differ for each source! 9.9.1 Sending NTP requests and interpreting responses Let’s consider a client-server situation where your computer wants to correct its own time. For every computer that you check with—let’s call these time servers—there are two messages: \\uf0a1The message from your computer to each time server is the request. \\uf0a1The reply is known as the response. These two messages generate four time points. Note that these occur in serial: \\uf0a1T1—The client’s timestamp for when the request was sent. Referred to as t1 in code. \\uf0a1T2—The time server’s timestamp for when the request was received. Referred to as t2 in code. \\uf0a1T3—The time server’s timestamp for when it sends its response.

You will have a solid understanding of the different tools that are available to you as an applications programmer. This chapter exposes you to the standard library and the well engineered crates crossbeam and rayon.

The chapter follows the following structure: \\uf0a1It introduces you to Rust’s closure syntax in section 10.1. Closures are also known as anonymous functions and lambda functions. The syntax is important because the standard library and many (perhaps all) external crates rely on that syntax to provide support for Rust’s concurrency model. \\uf0a1It provides a quick lesson on spawning threads in section 10.2. You’ll learn what a thread is and how to create (spawn) those. You’ll also encounter a discussion of why programmers are warned against spawning tens of thousands of threads. \\uf0a1It distinguishes between functions and closures in section 10.3. Conflating these two concepts can be a source of confusion for programmers new to Rust as these are often indistinguishable in other languages. \\uf0a1It follows with a large project in section 10.4. You’ll implement a multithreaded parser and a code generator using multiple strategies. As a nice aside, you get to create procedural art along the way. \\uf0a1The chapter concludes with an overview of other forms of concurrency. This includes processes and containers. 10.1 Anonymous functions This chapter is fairly dense, so let’s get some points on the board quickly with some basic syntax and practical examples. We’ll circle back to fill in a lot of the conceptual and theoretical material.  Threads and other forms of code that can run concurrently use a form of function definition that we’ve avoided for the bulk of the book. Taking a look at it now, defin- ing a function looks like this: fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {   a + b } The (loosely) equivalent lambda function is let add = |a,b| { a + b }; Lambda functions are denoted by the pair of vertical bars (|…|) followed by curly brackets ({…}).

As described in section 10.1, anonymous functions are defined with two vertical bars to provide arguments and then curly brackets for the function’s body. Because spawn() doesn’t take any arguments, you will typically encounter this syntax: thread::spawn(|| {     // ... }); When the spawned thread wants to access variables that are defined in the parent’s scope, called a capture, Rust often complains that captures must be moved into the clo- sure. To indicate that you want to move ownership, anonymous functions take a move keyword: thread::spawn(move || {        // ... }); Why is move required? Closures spawned in subthreads can potentially outlive their calling scope. As Rust will always ensure that accessing the data is valid, it requires Listing 10.1 Defining two functions and checking the result The move keyword allows the  anonymous function to access  variables from their wider scope.',\n",

Rather than iterating through the handlers vector, we call pop() and then drain it. The following two snip- pets compare the more familiar for loop (listing 10.6) with the control flow mecha- nism that is actually employed (listing 10.7). 19 for handle in &handlers { 20   handle.join(); 21 } 19 while let Some(handle) = handlers.pop() { 20   handle.join(); 21 } Why use the more complex control flow mechanism? It might help to remember that once we join a thread back to the main thread, it ceases to exist. Rust won’t allow us to retain a reference to something that doesn’t exist. Therefore, to call join() on a thread handler within handlers, the thread handler must be removed from handlers. That poses a problem. A for loop does not permit modifications to the data being iterated over. Instead, the while loop allows us to repeatedly gain mutable access when calling handlers.pop().  Listing 10.8 provides a broken implementation of the spin loop strategy. It is bro- ken because it uses the more familiar for loop control flow that was avoided in listing 10.5. You’ll find the source for this listing in c10/ch10-busythreads-broken/src/ main.rs.

Iterating over handlers directly retains ownership. That pushes any concerns about shared access to the side, and we can proceed as intended. YIELDING CONTROL WITH THREAD::YIELD_NOW() As a reminder, the busy loop within listing 10.5 includes some unfamiliar code, repeated in the following listing. This section explains its significance. 14 while start.elapsed() < pause { 15   thread::yield_now(); 16 } std::thread::yield_now() is a signal to the OS that the current thread should be unscheduled. This allows other threads to proceed while the current thread is still waiting for the 20 ms to arrive. A downside to yielding is that we don’t know if we’ll be able to resume at exactly 20 ms.  An alternative to yielding is to use the function std::sync::atomic::spin_loop _hint(). spin_loop_hint() avoids the OS; instead, it directly signals the CPU. A CPU might use that hint to turn off functionality, thus saving power usage. NOTE The spin_loop_hint() instruction is not present for every CPU. On platforms that don’t support it, spin_loop_hint() does nothing.  10.2.6 Shared variables In our threading benchmarks, we created pause variables in each thread.

Those structs are invisible in source code but contain any vari- ables from the closure’s environment that are used inside it.  Functions are implemented as function pointers. A function pointer is a pointer that points to code, not data. Code, when used in this sense, is computer memory that has been marked as executable. To complicate matters, closures that do not enclose any variables from their environment are also function pointers. 10.4 Procedurally generated avatars from a multithreaded  parser and code generator This section applies the syntax that we learned in section 10.2 to an application. Let’s say that we want the users of our app to have unique pictorial avatars by default. One approach for doing this is to take their usernames and the digest of a hash function, and then use those digits as parameter inputs to some procedural generation logic. Using this approach, everyone will have visually similar yet completely distinctive default avatars.  Our application creates parallax lines. It does this by using the characters within the Base 16 alphabet as opcodes for a LOGO-like language.

The SVG file format suc- cinctly describes drawings using mathematical operations. You can view the SVG file in any web browser and many graphics packages. Very little of the program relates to multithreading at this stage, so I’ll skip much of the details. The program has a simple pipeline comprised of four steps: 1 Receives input from STDIN 2 Parses the input into operations that describe the movement of a pen across a sheet of paper 3 Converts the movement operations into its SVG equivalent 4 Generates an SVG file Generates some input from  the Base 16 alphabet  (e.g., 0-9 and A-F) The project creates a  filename that matches  the input data.

There’s plenty of opportunity  to add more instructions to  produce more elaborate  diagrams without increasing  the parsing complexity.

At a surface level, the primary change is that there is no longer a need to create the temporary variable steps. The partnership of map() and collect() removes the need for that: map() applies a function to every element of an iterator, and collect() stores the out- put of an iterator into a Vec<T>.  There is also a more fundamental change than eliminating temporary variables in this refactor, though. It has provided more opportunities for the Rust compiler to optimize your code’s execution.  In Rust, iterators are an efficient abstraction. Working with their methods directly allows the Rust compiler to create optimal code that takes up minimal memory. As an example, the map() method takes a closure and applies it to every element of the iter- ator. Rust’s trick is that map() also returns an iterator. This allows many transforma- tions to be chained together. Significantly, although map() may appear in multiple places in your source code, Rust often optimizes those function calls away in the compiled binary.  When every step that the program should take is specified, such as when your code uses for loops, you restrict the number of places where the compiler can make deci- sions. Iterators provide an opportunity for you to delegate more work to the compiler. This ability to delegate is what will shortly unlock parallelism.  USING A PARALLEL ITERATOR We’re going to cheat here and make use of a crate from the Rust community: rayon. rayon is explicitly designed to add data parallelism to your code. Data parallelism applies the same function (or closure!) on different data (such as a Vec<T>).  Assuming that you’ve already worked with the base render-hex project, add rayon to your crate’s dependencies with cargo by executing cargo add rayon@1: $ cargo add rayon@1        Updating 'https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index' index       Adding rayon v1 to dependencies Listing 10.20 Implementing parse() with functional programming constructs Run cargo install cargo-edit if the  cargo add command is unavailable.\",\n",

       "  'text': '354 CHAPTER 10 Processes, threads, and containers  There are many approaches to modeling a task queue. We could create a Vec<Task> and Vec<Result> and share references to these across threads. To prevent each thread from overwriting each other, we would need a data protection strategy.  The most common tool to protect data shared between threads is Arc<Mutex<T>>. Fully expanded, that’s your value T (e.g., Vec<Task> or Vec<Result> here) protected by a std::sync::Mutex, which itself is wrapped within std::sync::Arc. A Mutex is a mutually-exclusive lock. Mutually exclusive in this context means that no one has spe- cial rights. A lock held by any thread prevents all others. Awkwardly, a Mutex must itself be protected between threads. So we call in extra support. The Arc provides safe multithreaded access to the Mutex.  Mutex and Arc are not unified into a single type to provide programmers with added flexibility. Consider a struct with several fields. You may only need a Mutex on a single field, but you could put the Arc around the whole struct. This approach pro- vides faster read access to the fields that are not protected by the Mutex. A single Mutex retains maximum protection for the field that has read-write access. The lock approach, while workable, is cumbersome. Channels offer a simpler alternative.  Channels have two ends: sending and receiving. Programmers don’t get access to what is happening inside the channel. But placing data at the sending end means it’ll appear at the receiving end at some future stage. Channels can be used as a task queue because multiple items can be sent, even if a receiver is not ready to receive any messages.  Channels are fairly abstract. These hide their internal structure, preferring to dele- gate access to two helper objects. One can send(); the other can recv() (receive). Importantly, we don’t get access to how channels transmit any information sent through the channel. NOTE By convention, from radio and telegraph operators, the Sender is called tx (shorthand for transmission) and the Receiver is called rx. ONE-WAY COMMUNICATION This section uses the channels implementation from the crossbeam crate rather than from the std::sync::mpsc module within the Rust standard library. Both APIs pro- vide the same API, but crossbeam provides greater functionality and flexibility. We’ll spend a little time explaining how to use channels. If you would prefer to see them used as a task queue, feel free to skip ahead.  The standard library provides a channels implementation, but we’ll make use of the third-party crate, crossbeam. It provides slightly more features. For example, it includes both bounded queues and unbounded queues. A bounded queue applies back pres- sure under contention, preventing the consumer from becoming overloaded. Bounded queues (of fixed-width types) have deterministic maximum memory usage. These do have one negative characteristic, though. They force queue producers to wait until a space is available. This can make unbounded queues unsuitable for asynchronous messages, which cannot tolerate waiting.',\n",

It allows the main thread to block and wait for a message. \\uf0a1Macros can define their own syntax rules. That is why the select! macro uses syntax (recv(rx) ->) that is not legal Rust.  WHAT CAN BE SENT THROUGH A CHANNEL? Mentally, you might be thinking of a channel like you would envision a network proto- col. Over the wire, however, you only have the type [u8] available to you. That byte stream needs to be parsed and validated before its contents can be interpreted.  Channels are richer than simply streaming bytes ([u8]). A byte stream is opaque and requires parsing to have structure extracted out of it. Channels offer you the full power of Rust’s type system. I recommend using an enum for messages as it offers exhaustiveness testing for robustness and has a compact internal representation.  TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION Bi-directional (duplex) communication is awkward to model with a single channel. An approach that’s simpler to work with is to create two sets of senders and receivers, one for each direction.

Moreover, isolation is often implemented in software. Run- ning extra software implies taking on extra runtime overhead. A small glossary of terms relating to concurrency This subfield is filled with jargon. Here is a brief introduction to some important terms and how we use them: \\uf0a1Program—A program, or application, is a brand name. It’s a name that we use to refer to a software package. When we execute a program, the OS creates a process. \\uf0a1Executable—A file that can be loaded into memory and then run. Running an executable means creating a process and a thread for it, then changing the CPU’s instruction pointer to the first instruction of the executable. \\uf0a1Task—This chapter uses the term task in an abstract sense. Its meaning shifts as the level of abstraction changes: a When discussing processes, a task is one of the process’s threads. b When referring to a thread, a task might be a function call. c When referring to an OS, a task might be a running program, which might be comprised of multiple processes. \\uf0a1Process—Running programs execute as processes. A process has its own vir- tual address space, at least one thread, and lots of bookkeeping managed by the OS. File descriptors, environment variables, and scheduling priorities are managed per process. A process has a virtual address space, executable code, open handles to system objects, a security context, a unique process identi- fier, environment variables, a priority class, minimum and maximum working set sizes, and at least one thread of execution. Each process is started with a single thread, often called the primary thread, but can create additional threads from any of its threads. Running pro- grams begin their life as a single process, but it isn’t uncommon to spawn subprocesses to do the work. \\uf0a1Thread—The thread metaphor is used to hint that multiple threads can work together as a whole. \\uf0a1Thread of execution—A sequence of CPU instructions that appear in serial. Multiple threads can run concurrently, but instructions within the sequence are intended to be executed one after another. \\uf0a1Coroutine—Also known as fibre, green thread, and lightweight thread, a corou- tine indicates tasks that switch within a thread. Switching between tasks becomes the responsibility of the program itself, rather than the OS. Two the- oretical concepts are important to distinguish: a Concurrency, which is multiple tasks of any level of abstraction running at the same time b Parallelism, which is multiple threads executing on multiple CPUs at the same time',\n",

Smaller forms of concurrency are invisible to the OS. You may have encoun- tered terms such as coroutines, fibers, and green threads.  Switching between tasks here is managed by the process itself. The OS is ignorant of the fact that a program is processing multiple tasks. For threads and other forms of concurrency, context switching is required.  10.5.2 What is a context switch? Switching between tasks at the same level of virtualization is known as a context switch. For threads to switch, CPU registers need to be cleared, CPU caches might need to be flushed, and variables within the OS need to be reset. As isolation increases, so does the cost of the context switch.  CPUs can only execute instructions in serial. To do more than one task, a com- puter, for example, needs to be able to press the Save Game button, switch to a new task, and resume at that task’s saved spot. The CPU is save scum.  Why is the CPU constantly switching tasks? Because it has so much time available. Programs often need to access data from memory, disk, or the network. Because wait- ing for data is incredibly slow, there’s often sufficient time to do something else in the meantime.  (continued) Outside of the fundamental terminology, there are also interrelated terms that appear frequently: asynchronous programming and non-blocking I/O. Many operating sys- tems provide non-blocking I/O facilities, where data from multiple sockets is batched into queues and periodically polled as a group. Here are the definitions for these: \\uf0a1Non-blocking I/O—Normally a thread is unscheduled when it asks for data from I/O devices like the network. The thread is marked as blocked, while it waits for data to arrive. When programming with non-blocking I/O, the thread can continue execut- ing even while it waits for data. But there is a contradiction. How can a thread continue to execute if it doesn’t have any input data to process? The answer lies in asynchronous programming. \\uf0a1Asynchronous programming—Asynchronous programming describes program- ming for cases where the control flow is not predetermined. Instead, events outside the control of the program itself impact the sequence of what is exe- cuted. Those events are typically related to I/O, such as a device driver sig- nalling that it is ready, or are related to functions returning in another thread. The asynchronous programming model is typically more complicated for the developer, but results in a faster runtime for I/O-heavy workloads. Speed increases because there are fewer system calls. This implies fewer context switches between the user space and the kernel space.',\n",

The distinguishing characteristic of a process is that its memory is independent from other processes. The OS, in conjunction with the CPU, protects a process’s memory from all others.  To share data between processes, Rust channels and data protected by Arc<Mutex<_>> won’t suffice. You need some support from the OS. For this, reusing network sockets is common. Most operating systems provide specialized forms of interprocess communi- cation (IPC), which are faster, while being less portable.  10.5.4 WebAssembly WebAssembly (Wasm) is interesting because it is an attempt at isolating tasks within the process boundary itself. It’s impossible for tasks running inside a Wasm module to access memory available to other tasks. Originating in web browsers, Wasm treats all code as potentially hostile. If you use third-party dependencies, it’s likely that you haven’t verified the behavior of all of the code that your process executes.  In a sense, Wasm modules are given access to address spaces within your process’s address space. Wasm address spaces are called linear memory. Runtime interprets any request for data within linear memory and makes its own request to the actual virtual memory. Code within the Wasm module is unaware of any memory addresses that the process has access to.  10.5.5 Containers Containers are extensions to processes with further isolation provided by the OS. Pro- cesses share the same filesystem, whereas containers have a filesystem created for them. The same is true for other resources, such as the network. Rather than address space, the term used for protections covering these other resources is namespaces.  10.5.6 Why use an operating system (OS) at all? It’s possible to run an application as its own OS. Chapter 11 provides one implementa- tion. The general term for an application that runs without an OS is to describe it as freestanding—freestanding in the sense that it does not require the support of an OS. Freestanding binaries are used by embedded software developers when there is no OS to rely on.  Using freestanding binaries can involve significant limitations, though. Without an OS, applications no longer have virtual memory or multithreading. All of those con- cerns become your application’s concerns. To reach a middle ground, it is possible to compile a unikernel. A unikernel is a minimal OS paired with a single application. The compilation process strips out everything from the OS that isn’t used by the applica- tion that’s being deployed.',\n",

For now, success is being able to compile your own version of Rust, an OS kernel using that Rust, a bootloader that puts your kernel in the right place, and having these all work together.  Getting this far is a big achievement. As mentioned earlier, creating a program that targets an OS kernel that doesn’t exist yet is complicated. Several steps are required: 1 Create a machine-readable definition of the conventions that the OS uses, such as the intended CPU architecture. This is the target platform, also known as a com- piler target or simply target. You have seen targets before. Try executing rustup target list for a list that you can compile Rust to. 2 Compile Rust for the target definition to create the new target. We’ll suffice with a subset of Rust called core that excludes the standard library (crates under std). 3 Compile the OS kernel for the new target using the “new” Rust. 4 Compile a bootloader that can load the new kernel. 5 Execute the bootloader in a virtual environment, which, in turn, runs the kernel. Thankfully, the bootimage crate does all of this for us. With all of that fully automated, we’re able to focus on the interesting pieces.

There are no other running programs. To indicate this, our functions’ return type is the Never type (!). \\uf0a1If the program crashes, the whole computer crashes. The only thing that our program can do when an error occurs is terminate. We indicate this by relying on LLVM’s abort() function. This is explained in more detail in section 11.2.4. \\uf0a1We must disable the standard library with ![no_std]. As our application cannot rely on an OS to provide dynamic memory allocation, it’s important to avoid any code that dynamically allocates memory. The ![no_std] annotation excludes the Rust standard library from our crate. This has the side effect of preventing many types, such as Vec<T>, from being available to our program. \\uf0a1We need to unlock the unstable core_intrinsics API with the #![core_intrinsics] attribute. Part of the Rust compiler is provided by LLVM, the compiler produced by the LLVM project. LLVM exposes parts of its internals to Rust, which are known as intrinsic functions. As LLVM’s internals are not subject to Rust’s stabil- ity guarantees, there is always a risk that what is offered to Rust will change. Therefore, this implies that we must use the nightly compiler toolchain and explicitly opt into the unstable API in our program. \\uf0a1We need to disable the Rust symbol-naming conventions with the #![no_mangle] attribute. Symbol names are strings within the compiled binary. For multiple libraries to coexist at runtime, it’s important that these names do not collide.

Avoiding the standard library is useful in that it greatly simplifies compilation, but manual panic handling is one of its costs. The following listing is an excerpt from listing 11.4.

This area of memory is called the frame buffer.  Our bootloader designates 0xb8000 as the start of a 4,000 byte frame buffer. To actually set the value, our code uses two new methods, offset() and write_volatile(), that you haven’t encountered before. The following listing, an excerpt from listing 11.4, shows how these are used. 18   let mut framebuffer = 0xb8000 as *mut u8; 19   unsafe { 20       framebuffer 21         .offset(1) 22         .write_volatile(0x30); 23   } Here is a short explanation of the two new methods: \\uf0a1Moving through an address space with offset()—A pointer type’s offset() method moves through the address space in increments that align to the size of the pointer. For example, calling .offset(1) on a *mut u8 (mutable pointer to a u8) adds 1 to its address. When that same call is made to a *mut u32 (mutable pointer to a u32), the pointer’s address moves by 4 bytes. \\uf0a1Forcing a value to be written to memory with write_volatile()—Pointers provide a write_volatile() method that issues a “volatile” write. Volatile prevents the compiler’s optimizer from optimizing away the write instruction. A smart com- piler might simply notice that we are using lots of constants everywhere and ini- tialize the program such that the memory is simply set to the value that we want it to be.

Using this style requires diligence. Without the aid of type safety provided by offset(), it’s easy for a typo to cause memory corrup- tion. The verbose coding style used in listing 11.7 is also friendlier to programmers with less experience performing pointer arithmetic. It declares its own intent.  11.2.6 _start(): The main() function for FledgeOS An OS kernel does not include the concept of a main() function, in the sense that you’re used to. For one thing, an OS kernel’s main loop never returns. Where would it return to? By convention, programs return an error code when they exit to an OS. But operating systems don’t have an OS to provide an exit code to. Secondly, starting a program at main() is also a convention. But that convention also doesn’t exist for OS kernels. To start an OS kernel, we require some software to talk directly to the CPU. The software is called a bootloader.  The linker expects to see one symbol defined, _start, which is the program’s entry point. It links _start to a function that’s defined by your source code.  In an ordinary environment, the _start() function has three jobs. Its first is to reset the system. On an embedded system, for example, _start() might clear regis- ters and reset memory to 0. Its second job is to call main(). Its third is to call _exit(), which cleans up after main(). Our _start() function doesn’t perform the last two jobs. Job two is unnecessary as the application’s functionality is simple enough to keep within _start(). Job three is unnecessary, as is main(). If it were to be called, it would never return.  11.3 fledgeos-1: Avoiding a busy loop Now that the foundations are in place, we can begin to add features to FledgeOS. 11.3.1 Being power conscious by interacting with the CPU directly Before proceeding, FledgeOS needs to address one major shortcoming: it is extremely power hungry. The _start() function from listing 11.4 actually runs a CPU core at 100%. It’s possible to avoid this by issuing the halt instruction (hlt) to the CPU.

Another approach to explore is to use inline assembly. The latter approach is demonstrated briefly in section 12.3.  11.4 fledgeos-2: Custom exception handling The next iteration of FledgeOS improves on its error-handling capabilities. FledgeOS still crashes when an error is triggered, but we now have a framework for building something more sophisticated. 11.4.1 Handling exceptions properly, almost FledgeOS cannot manage any exceptions generated from the CPU when it detects an abnormal operation. To handle exceptions, our program needs to define an exception- handling personality function.  Personality functions are called on each stack frame as the stack is unwound after an exception. This means the call stack is traversed, invoking the personality function at each stage. The personality function’s role is to determine whether the current stack frame is able to handle the exception. Exception handling is also known as catch- ing an exception. NOTE What is stack unwinding? When functions are called, stack frames accu- mulate. Traversing the stack in reverse is called unwinding. Eventually, unwind- ing the stack will hit _start(). Because handling exceptions in a rigorous way is not necessary for FledgeOS, we’ll implement only the bare minimum. Listing 11.11, an excerpt from listing 11.12, pro- vides a snippet of code with the minimal handler. Inject it into main.rs. An empty function implies that any exception is fatal because none will be marked as the han- dler. When an exception occurs, we don’t need to do anything. 4 #![feature(lang_items)] 18 #[lang = \"eh_personality\"] 19 #[no_mangle] 20 pub extern \"C\" fn eh_personality() { } Listing 11.11 Minimalist exception-handling personality routine',\n",

But there are times when we need to pull in the reins. External systems often demand that our data matches their requirements.  Listing 11.13 provides an example of fitting the colors from the VGA-compatible text mode palette enum into a single u8. It removes any discretion from the compiler about which bit pattern (formally called the discriminant) to associate with particular variants. To prescribe a representation, add the repr attribute. You are then able to specify any integer type (i32, u8, i16, u16,…), as well as some special cases.  Using a prescribed representation has some disadvantages. In particular, it reduces your flexibility. It also prevents Rust from making space optimizations. Some enums, those with a single variant, require no representation. These appear in source code but occupy zero space in the running program.  11.5.3 Why use enums? You could model colors differently. For instance, it’s possible to create numeric con- stants that look identical in memory. The following shows one such possibility: const BLACK: u8 = 0x0; const BLUE: u8 = 0x1; // ... Using an enum adds an extra guard. It becomes much more difficult to use an illegal value in our code than if we were using an u8 directly. You will see this demonstrated when the Cursor struct is introduced in listing 11.17.  11.5.4 Creating a type that can print to the VGA frame buffer To print to the screen, we’ll use a Cursor struct that handles the raw memory manipu- lation and can convert between our Color type and what is expected by VGA. As the following listing shows, this type manages the interface between our code and the VGA frame buffer.

There is a lot of jargon to take in. To make matters worse, the terms all look sim- ilar, and it certainly does not help that these are often used interchangeably. Here are some examples of the jargon that is used in this chapter. Figure 12.1 illustrates how these interrelate: \\uf0a1Abort—An unrecoverable exception. If an application triggers an abort, the application terminates. \\uf0a1Fault—A recoverable exception that is expected in routine operations such as a page fault. Page faults occur when a memory address is not available and data must be fetched from the main memory chip(s). This process is known as vir- tual memory and is explained in section 4 of chapter 6. \\uf0a1Exception—Exception is an umbrella term that incudes aborts, faults, and traps. Formally referred to as synchronous interrupts, exceptions are sometimes described as a form of an interrupt. \\uf0a1Hardware interrupt—An interrupt generated by a device such as a keyboard or hard disk controller. Typically used by devices to notify the CPU that data is available to be read from the device. \\uf0a1Interrupt—A hardware-level term that is used in two senses. It can refer only to synchronous interrupts, which include hardware and software interrupts. Depend- ing on context, it can also include exceptions. Interrupts are usually handled by the OS. \\uf0a1Signal—An OS-level term for interruptions to an application’s control flow. Sig- nals are handled by applications. \\uf0a1Software interrupt—An interrupt generated by a program. Within Intel’s x86 CPU family, programs can trigger an interrupt with the INT instruction. Among other uses of this facility, debuggers use software interrupts to set breakpoints. \\uf0a1Trap—A recoverable exception such as an integer overflow detected by the CPU. Integer overflow is explained in section 5.2. NOTE The meaning of the term exception may differ from your previous pro- gramming experience. Programming languages often use the term exception to refer to any error, whereas the term has a specialized meaning when refer- ring to CPUs. 12.1.1 Signals vs. interrupts The two concepts that are most important to distinguish between are signals and interrupts.

They’re analogous to a physical, audible buzzer. The buzzer doesn’t provide content, but the person who presses it still knows what’s intended as it makes a very jarring sound. To add confusion to the mix, signals are often described as software interrupts. This chapter, however, avoids the use of the term interrupt when referring to a signal.  There are two forms of interrupts, which differ in their origin. One form of inter- rupt occurs within the CPU during its processing. This is the result of attempting to process illegal instructions and trying to access invalid memory addresses. This first form is known technically as a synchronous interrupt, but you may have heard it referred to by its more common name, exception.  The second form of interrupt is generated by hardware devices like keyboards and accelerometers. This is what’s commonly implied by the term interrupt. This can occur at any time and is formally known as an asynchronous interrupt. Like signals, this can also be generated within software.  Interrupts can be specialized. A trap is an error detected by the CPU, so it gives the OS a chance to recover. A fault is another form of a recoverable problem. If the CPU is given a memory address that it can’t read from, it notifies the OS and asks for an updated address. Exceptions Faults Recoverable Page fault Traps Recoverable Integer overﬂow Aborts Unrecoverable Double fault (second fault occurred while handling ﬁrst) Interrupts Interrupts Devices reporting that data is ready Software deﬁned CPU given INT instruction (on x86) Hardware deﬁned Intel deﬁnes three forms of exception classes.

Upon receiving an interrupt, the CPU jumps to handler code, irrespective of the current state of the program. The location of the handler code is predefined by the BIOS and OS during a system’s bootup process. 12.2 How interrupts affect applications Let’s work through this challenge by considering a small code example. The following listing shows a simple calculation that sums two integers. 1 fn add(a: i32, b:i32) -> i32 { 2   a + b 3 } 4  5 fn main() { 6   let a = 5; 7   let b = 6; 8   let c = add(a,b); 9 } Irrespective of the number of hardware interrupts, c is always calculated. But the pro- gram’s wall clock time becomes nondeterministic because the CPU performs different tasks every time it runs. Treating signals as interrupts Handling interrupts directly means manipulating the OS kernel. Because we would prefer not to do that in a learning environment, we’ll play fast and loose with the ter- minology. The rest of this chapter, therefore, treats signals as interrupts. Why simplify things? Writing OS components involves tweaking the kernel. Breaking things there means that our system could become completely unresponsive without a clear way to fix anything. From a more pragmatic perspective, avoiding tweaks to the kernel means that we’ll avoid learning a whole new compiler toolchain. To our advantage, code that handles signals looks similar to code that handles inter- rupts. Practicing with signals allows us to keep any errors within our code constrained to our application rather than risk bringing the whole system down. The general pat- tern is as follows: 1 Model your application’s standard control flow. 2 Model the interrupted control flow and identify resources that need to be cleanly shut down, if required. 3 Write the interrupt/signal handler to update some state and return quickly. 4 You will typically delegate time-consuming operations by only modifying a global variable that is regularly checked by the main loop of the program. 5 Modify your application’s standard control flow to look for the GO/NO GO flag that a signal handler may have changed.

Programs can avoid the others.  12.6 Handling signals with custom actions The default actions for signals are fairly limited. By default, receiving a signal tends to end badly for applications. For example, if external resources such as database connec- tions are left open, they might not be cleaned up properly when the application ends.  The most common use case for signal handlers is to allow an application to shut down cleanly. Some common tasks that might be necessary when an application shuts down include \\uf0a1Flushing the hard disk drive to ensure that pending data is written to disk \\uf0a1Closing any network connections \\uf0a1Deregistering from any distributed scheduler or work queue To stop the current workload and shut down, a signal handler is required. To set up a signal handler, we need to create a function with the signature f(i32) -> (). That is, the function needs to accept an i32 integer as its sole argument and returns no value.  This poses some software engineering issues. The signal handler isn’t able to access any information from the application except which signal was sent. Therefore, because it doesn’t know what state anything is in, it doesn’t know what needs shutting down beforehand.  There are some additional restrictions in addition to the architectural one. Signal handlers are constrained in time and scope.

For example, they must avoid executing any code that might itself generate signals.  To wriggle out of this constrained environment, the ordinary approach is to use a Boolean flag as a global variable that is regularly checked during a program’s execution. If the flag is set, then you can call a function to shutdown the application cleanly within the context of the application. For this pattern to work, there are two requirements: \\uf0a1The signal handler’s sole responsibility is to mutate the flag. \\uf0a1The application must regularly check the flag to detect whether the flag has been modified. To avoid race conditions caused by multiple signal handlers running at the same time, signal handlers typically do little. A common pattern is to set a flag via a global variable. 12.6.1 Global variables in Rust Rust facilitates global variables (variables accessible anywhere within the program) by declaring a variable with the static keyword in global scope. Suppose we want to cre- ate a global value SHUT_DOWN that we can set to true when a signal handler believes it’s time to urgently shut down. We can use this declaration: static mut SHUT_DOWN: bool = false; NOTE static mut is read as mutable static, irrespective of how grammatically contorted that is. Global variables present an issue for Rust programmers. Accessing these (even just for reading) is unsafe. This means that the code can become quite cluttered if it’s wrapped in unsafe blocks. This ugliness is a signal to wary programmers—avoid global state whenever possible.  Listing 12.6 presents a example of a static mut variable that reads from line 12 and writes to lines 7–9. The call to rand::random() on line 8 produces Boolean val- ues. Output is a series of dots.

Within your business rules, you can create definitions for SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2. These are unallocated by design. In listing 12.8, we used SIGUSR1 to do a small task. It simply prints the string SIGUSR1. A more realistic use of custom signals is to notify a peer application that some data is ready for further processing. 12.7.1 Understanding function pointers and their syntax Listing 12.8 includes some syntax that might be confusing. For example, on line 40 handle_sigterm as usize appears to cast a function as an integer.  What is happening here? The address where the function is stored is being con- verted to an integer. In Rust, the fn keyword creates a function pointer.  Readers who have worked through chapter 5 will understand that functions are just data. That is to say, functions are sequences of bytes that make sense to the CPU. A function pointer is a pointer to the start of that sequence. Refer back to chapter 5, especially section 5.7, for a refresher.  A pointer is a data type that acts as a stand-in for its referent. Within an application’s source code, pointers contain both the address of the value referred to as well as its type. The type information is something that’s stripped away in the compiled binary. The internal representation for pointers is an integer of usize. That makes pointers very economical to pass around. In C, making use of function pointers can feel like arcane magic. In Rust, they hide in plain sight.   Understanding the difference between const and static Static and constant seem similar. Here is the main difference between them: \\uf0a1 static values appear in a single location in memory. \\uf0a1 const values can be duplicated in locations where they are accessed. Duplicating const values can be a CPU-friendly optimization. It allows for data locality and improved cache performance. Why use confusingly similar names for two different things? It could be considered a historical accident. The word static refers to the segment of the address space that the variables live in. static values live outside the stack space, within the region where string literals are held, near the bottom of the address space. That means accessing a static variable almost certainly implies dereferencing a pointer. The constant in const values refers to the value itself. When accessed from code, the data might get duplicated to every location that it’s needed if the compiler believes that this will result in faster access.',\n",

When receiving a signal, the program might want to execute some cleanup code before terminating (or being forcefully terminated). This is sometimes referred to as nonlocal control transfer. UNIX-based operating systems provide some tools to enable you to make use of that machinery via two system calls—setjmp and longjmp: \\uf0a1 setjmp sets a marker location. \\uf0a1 longjmp jumps back to the previously marked location. Why bother with such programming gymnastics? Sometimes using low-level tech- niques like these is the only way out of a tight spot. These approach the “Dark Arts” of systems programming. To quote the manpage: “setjmp() and longjmp() are useful for dealing with errors and interrupts encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.” —Linux Documentation Project: setjmp(3) These two tools circumvent normal control flow and allow programs to teleport them- selves through the code. Occasionally an error occurs deep within a call stack. If our program takes too long to respond to the error, the OS may simply abort the program, and the program’s data may be left in an inconsistent state. To avoid this, you can use longjmp to shift control directly to the error-handling code.  To understand the significance of this, consider what happens in an ordinary pro- gram’s call stack during several calls to a recursive function as produced by the code in listing 12.13. Each call to dive() adds another place that control eventually returns to. See the left-hand side of table 12.3. The longjmp system call, used by listing 12.17, bypasses several layers of the call stack. Its effect on the call stack is visible on the right- hand side of table 12.3. Table 12.3 Comparing the intended output from listing 12.13 and listing 12.17 Listing 12.13 produces a symmetrical pattern.  Each level is caused by a nested call to dive(),  which is removed when the calls return. Listing 12.17 produces a much different pattern.  After a few calls to dive(), control teleports back  to main() without returning the calls to dive(). # ## ### #### ##### ### ## # # ## ### early return! finishing!

Using an intrinsic function with Rust takes some ceremony to set up, but that operates as a standard function once the set-up is in place. 12.9.1 Introducing the sjlj project The sjlj project demonstrates contorting the normal control flow of a function. With the help of some assistance from the OS and the compiler, it’s actually possi- ble to create a situation where a function can move to anywhere in the program. Listing 12.17 uses that functionality to bypass several layers of the call stack, creating the output from the right side of table 12.3. Figure 12.5 shows the control flow for the sjlj project.  12.9.2 Setting up intrinsics in a program Listing 12.17 uses two intrinsics, setjmp() and longjmp().

For example \\uf0a1 extern \"C\" means “This block of code should obey C’s conventions rather than Rust’s.” \\uf0a1The link_name attribute tells the linker where to find the two functions that we’re declaring. \\uf0a1The eh in llvm.eh.sjlj.setjmp stands for exception handling, and the sjlj stands for setjmp/longjmp. \\uf0a1 *mut i8 is a pointer to a signed byte. For those with C programming experi- ence, you might recognize this as the pointer to the beginning of a string (e.g., a *char type). WHAT IS AN INTRINSIC FUNCTION? Intrinsic functions, generally referred to as intrinsics, are functions made available via the compiler rather than as part of the language. Whereas Rust is largely target-agnostic, the compiler has access to the target environment. This access can facilitate extra functionality. For example, a compiler understands the characteristics of the CPU that the to-be-compiled program will run on. The compiler can make that CPU’s instruc- tions available to the program via intrinsics. Some examples of intrinsic functions include \\uf0a1Atomic operations—Many CPUs provide specialist instructions to optimize certain workloads. For example, the CPU might guarantee that updating an integer is an atomic operation. Atomic here is meant in the sense of being indivisible.

The jmp_buf type is defined like this: const JMP_BUF_WIDTH: usize =   mem::size_of::<usize>() * 8;     type jmp_buf = [i8; JMP_BUF_WIDTH]; The jmp_buf type is a type alias for an array of i8 that is as wide as 8 usize integers. The role of jmp_buf is to store the state of the program, such that the CPU’s registers can be repopulated when needed. There is only one jmp_buf value within listing 12.17, a global mutable static called RETURN_HERE, defined on line 14. The following exam- ple shows how jmp_buf is initialized: static mut RETURN_HERE: jmp_buf = [0; JMP_BUF_WIDTH]; How do we treat RETURN_HERE as a pointer? Within the Rust code, we refer to RETURN_ HERE as a reference (&RETURN_HERE). LLVM expects those bytes to be presented as a *mut i8. To perform the conversion, we apply four steps, which are all packed into a single line: unsafe { &RETURN_HERE as *const i8 as *mut i8 } Let’s explain what those four steps are: 1 Start with &RETURN_HERE, a read-only reference to a global static variable of type [i8; 8] on 64-bit machines or [i8; 4] on 32-bit machines. 2 Convert that reference to a *const i8. Casting between pointer types is consid- ered safe Rust, but deferencing that pointer requires an unsafe block. 3 Convert the *const i8 to a *mut i8. This declares the memory as mutable (read/write). 4 Wrap the conversion in an unsafe block because it deals with accessing a global variable. Why not use something like &mut RETURN_HERE as *mut i8? The Rust compiler becomes quite concerned about giving LLVM access to its data. The approach provided here, starting with a read-only reference, puts Rust at ease.  12.9.4 Compiling the sjlj project We’re now in a position where possible points of confusion about listing 12.17 should be minor. The following snippet again shows the behavior we’re attempting to replicate: 2 jmp_buf is the conventional name for this buffer, which might be useful for any readers who want to dive deeper themselves.

On MS Windows, for example, command-line applications need to provide a handler function to the kernel via SetConsoleCtrlHandler. That handler function is then invoked when a signal is sent to the application.  Regardless of the specific mechanism, the high-level approach demonstrated in this chapter should be fairly portable. Here is the pattern: \\uf0a1Your CPU generates interrupts that require the OS to respond. \\uf0a1Operating systems often delegate responsibility for handling interrupts via some sort of callback system. \\uf0a1A callback system means creating a function pointer.  12.11 Revising exceptions At the start of the chapter, we discussed the distinction between signals, interrupts, and exceptions. There was little coverage of exceptions, directly. We have treated these as a special class of interrupts. Interrupts themselves have been modeled as signals.  To wrap up this chapter (and the book), we explored some of the features avail- able in rustc and LLVM. The bulk of this chapter utilized these features to work with signals. Within Linux, signals are the main mechanism that the OS uses to communi- cate with applications. On the Rust side, we have spent lots of time interacting with libc and unsafe blocks, unpacking function pointers, and tweaking global variables.  Summary \\uf0a1Hardware devices, such as the computer’s network card, notify applications about data that is ready to be processed by sending an interrupt to the CPU. \\uf0a1Function pointers are pointers that point to executable code rather than to data. These are denoted in Rust by the fn keyword. \\uf0a1Unix operating systems manage job control with two signals: SIGSTOP and SIGCONT. \\uf0a1Signal handlers do the least amount of work possible to mitigate the risk of trigger- ing race conditions caused when multiple signal handlers operate concurrently. A typical pattern is to set a flag with a global variable. That flag is periodically checked within the program’s main loop. \\uf0a1To create a global variable in Rust, create a “mutable static.” Accessing mutable statics requires an unsafe block. \\uf0a1The OS, signals, and the compiler can be utilized to implement exception han- dling in programming languages via the setjmp and longjmp syscalls. \\uf0a1Without the unsafe keyword, Rust programs would not be able to interface effectively with the OS and other third-party components.',\n",
